# EU4-Gothic-Invasion
[Europa Universalis IV Mod] [Playable Yet Unfinished and Broken]

This was an ambitious Alt-History mod based on a Converterted CK2 game I worked on for 6 months. 
Most my work was creating nations from scratch and bug-fixing the things the converter left broken.

FEATURES:
*Completely different 1444 start, just about every nation has been changed. Alliances are lacking and many nations remain broken due to 
unfinished idea groups.

UNFINISHED FEATURES:
*New National ideas: Every nation was to have unique ideas! Most don't have localisation, however a handful of the new nations have
their modifiers in their ideas however. 
*Each Religion was to get their own mechanics! Bored with the lack of flavor for the converter religions I set out to add basic mechanics
to all the religions, reusing what Paradox allowed me I planned on giving EVERY religion that starts in 1444 flavor.
*New Events: (I made like a handful, and they sort of work)
*Flags!: I made custom flags for a lot of these nations, copy-pasting in photoshop elements of various converter flags I worked to 
make them as special as I could.
*Formable Nations: Tags exist, most can be formed at least. Not all however.
*Broken Japan and Mandate of Heaven!: Yeah I couldn't be assed to update it properly and was half finished there. 
*Custom Lore: Well, while it's not in there there is a lot of backstory for each nation, portraying alliances, rivalries, and important 
characters in history.
*Much more!

This mod was orignally converted in CK2 using the HIP mod with SWMH enabled, so credit to their team for a the Mod this was converted from.
Only localistion was borrowed with named of some heresies/religions which may not even still exist.

Requires the Mandate of Heaven Patch (Whichever version that one is)

USAGE: Seeing as this is completly broken, if you have a strange interest in my work here message me here or on Steam, I'd be willing to
hand the project off to you or Start it up again if you think you're up for the challange. Otherwise if you wish to just go solo please credit
me and add me as a creator on the Workshop to it. :)
