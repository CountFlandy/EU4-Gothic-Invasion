 #Canal Events#
 canal_events.EVTNAME1:0 "Poor Planning"
 canal_events.EVTDESC1:0 "It seems that the preparations for our canal construction in [Root.GetName] have been inadequate. The project has seen several setbacks recently due to poor planning. Putting together a commission to reorganize and re-plan the whole thing might get it back on schedule."
 canal_events.EVTOPTA1:0 "Go ahead"
 canal_events.EVTOPTB1:0 "It's too costly"
 canal_events.EVTNAME2:0 "Weak Leadership"
 canal_events.EVTDESC2:0 "Many of the troubles concerning our canal construction in [Root.GetName] seem to be related to weak leadership on site. We should consider replacing those in charge."
 canal_events.EVTOPTA2:0 "Commission new leaders"
 canal_events.EVTOPTB2:0 "They will have to make do"
 canal_events.EVTNAME3:0 "New Leadership?"
 canal_events.EVTDESC3:0 "In light of the many setbacks and hardships that have plagued our canal project in [Root.GetName], it's not surprising to hear that the local leadership has become dispirited and that much of the workforce has sunk into apathy. Perhaps we need to send someone else to take over and reorganize the operation?"
 canal_events.EVTOPTA3:0 "Commission new leaders for the project"
 canal_events.EVTOPTB3:0 "There are no resources for it"
 canal_events.EVTNAME4:0 "Dwindling Local Trade"
 canal_events.EVTDESC4:0 "Many of those who work on constructing the canal in [Root.GetName] supplement their living by selling trade goods to the local population. But lately this trade has dwindled, and without it many of the workers risk not surviving."
 canal_events.EVTOPTA4:0 "Help them alleviate the situation"
 canal_events.EVTOPTB4:0 "We can't be held responsible"
 canal_events.EVTNAME5:0 "Disastrous Landslide"
 canal_events.EVTDESC5:0 "Our canal project in [Root.GetName] seems cursed. A massive landslide has buried some of our labor camps, killing many and caused parts of the canal to be dredged again."
 canal_events.EVTOPTA5:0 "Send them more resources"
 canal_events.EVTOPTB5:0 "There is nothing we can do"
 canal_events.EVTNAME6:0 "Lack of Provision"
 canal_events.EVTDESC6:0 "Unforeseen problems have left our canal construction in [Root.GetName] low on provisions for its labor force. Unless additional provisions reach them quickly, the project might suffer serious setbacks."
 canal_events.EVTOPTA6:0 "Make sure they get what they need"
 canal_events.EVTOPTB6:0 "There is nothing we can do"
 canal_events.EVTNAME7:0 "Severe Floods"
 canal_events.EVTDESC7:0 "Severe floods have caused a lot of damage in [Root.GetName] and have thus delayed the construction of the canal. Unless it receives additional funds the project risks getting delayed."
 canal_events.EVTOPTA7:0 "Invest additional funds"
 canal_events.EVTOPTB7:0 "We can't afford it"
 canal_events.EVTNAME8:0 "Increased Drunkenness"
 canal_events.EVTDESC8:0 "Our idea to reward the workers on our canal project in [Root.GetName] with increased rations of alcohol seems to have unwanted effects. Increased drunkenness was expected but it also seems to have increased the death toll among those already weakened by dysentery and fever."
 canal_events.EVTOPTA8:0 "Reduce the rations again"
 canal_events.EVTOPTB8:0 "What's done is done"
 canal_events.EVTNAME9:0 "Rations of Alcohol"
 canal_events.EVTDESC9:0 "The miserable conditions surrounding our canal project in [Root.GetName] has left the workforce depressed and unmotivated. Something has to be done or the whole enterprise risk grinding to a halt. One suggestion has been to increase the rations of alcohol."
 canal_events.EVTOPTA9:0 "Sounds like a good idea"
 canal_events.EVTOPTB9:0 "It seems the wrong way to go"
 canal_events.EVTNAME10:0 "Canal Company Formed"
 canal_events.EVTDESC10:0 "A wealthy group of investors and merchants interested in the economic prospects of a canal through [Root.GetName] have formed a commercial company in order to support the construction."
 canal_events.EVTOPTA10:0 "Excellent!"
 canal_events.EVTNAME11:0 "Canal Company Scheme"
 canal_events.EVTDESC11:0 "It seems that the privately owned canal company that was set up a few years ago has gone bankrupt. They apparently faced severe economic problems early on, but hid this information from the public and deceived investors into sinking more and more money into the project. Many have been ruined by what is now commonly called the 'canal scheme' and angry mobs are gathering in [Root.Owner.Capital.GetCapitalName], demanding justice and economic retribution."
 canal_events.EVTOPTA11:0 "It is not our fault!"
 canal_events.EVTOPTB11:0 "Let's foot the bill..."
 canal_events.EVTNAME12:0 "Good Leadership?"
 canal_events.EVTDESC12:0 "Amazingly, it looks like our canal project in [Root.GetName] has progressed ahead of its schedule!"
 canal_events.EVTOPTA12:0 "Could this be true?"
 canal_events.EVTNAME13:0 "Good Weather"
 canal_events.EVTDESC13:0 "Our canal project in [Root.GetName] has been graced by good weather conditions lately and the work is progressing ahead of schedule!"
 canal_events.EVTOPTA13:0 "Finally some good news"
 canal_events.EVTNAME20:0 "Outbreak of Illness"
 canal_events.EVTDESC20:0 "An outbreak of illness has struck our canal project in [Root.GetName]! Many workers have deceased after suffering from fever, nausea and in some cases bleeding from the mouth and eyes. Reports mention the skin of some victims turning yellow..."
 canal_events.EVTOPTA20:0 "Send soldiers to replace them"
 canal_events.EVTOPTB20:0 "Pray and hope for the best"
 canal_events.EVTNAME21:0 "Outbreak of Illness"
 canal_events.EVTDESC21:0 "An outbreak of illness has struck our canal project in [Root.GetName]! The reports mention sudden coldness and shivering followed by fever and cases of vomiting, convulsions and damages to the eyes. It seems to appear frequently near swamps and marshland and has been named marsh fever or mala aria - Italian for bad air."
 canal_events.EVTOPTA21:0 "Send soldiers to take their place"
 canal_events.EVTOPTB21:0 "Don't risk more lives"
 canal_events.EVTNAME22:0 "Violent Thunderstorms"
 canal_events.EVTDESC22:0 "Even the weather seems to be against our canal project in [Root.GetName]. Violent thunderstorms have destroyed much of the camps and following mudslides have set us back severely."
 canal_events.EVTOPTA22:0 "Send them more resources"
 canal_events.EVTOPTB22:0 "There is nothing we can do"
 canal_events.EVTNAME23:0 "Canal Crossing River"
 canal_events.EVTDESC23:0 "Another problem to overcome for our canal project in [Root.GetName]: a local river is crossing the path of the canal. Because of the strong flow - especially in the rainy season - the water cannot just be dumped into the canal, as it would be too hazardous for the ships passing. So we need to divert the whole river..."
 canal_events.EVTOPTA23:0 "Hire more workers"
 canal_events.EVTOPTB23:0 "Send soldiers"
 canal_events.EVTNAME24:0 "Lack of Fresh Water"
 canal_events.EVTDESC24:0 "Our canal project in [Root.GetName] has progressed far inland. Unfortunately this has lead to the camps on the frontier no longer has an accessible source of fresh water. Additional resources are needed to make sure they can be supplied properly."
 canal_events.EVTOPTA24:0 "We will handle it"
 canal_events.EVTOPTB24:0 "Let them try to solve it"
 canal_events.25.t:0 "Kiel Canal Finished"
 canal_events.25.d:0 "By what has been considered an unprecedented construction effort in the region, the construction of the Kiel Canal connecting the North Sea with the Baltic has been completed in [Root.GetName]. Our fleet can now move between these key areas quicker and safer, giving us opportunity for unique military maneuvers and trade projects."
 canal_events.25.a:0 "It will change the course of ships and of history!"
 canal_events.26.t:0 "Suez Canal Finished"
 canal_events.26.d:0 "Throughout history, attempts have been made to connect the Red Sea and the Mediterranean in some capacity, but none have succeeded on the level of [Root.Owner.GetName]'s project. Where ships once needed to encircle a continent to travel between Europe and the Indian Ocean, the barrier of land that many captains have no doubt cursed for centuries has been chipped away by our ingenious engineers. None thought it would be possible for decades, but we dared not only to think it, but to do it."
 canal_events.27.t:0 "Panama Canal Finished"
 canal_events.27.d:0 "Many claimed it was impossible. Other put it in the realm of the distant future, or of dreams, but [Root.Owner.GetName] put it in the realm of reality. Of ideas to connect two oceans, the Atlantic and the Pacific always seemed the most distant, despite being separated by so little land. But through resilience, ingenuity and the sheer resources we have poured into the project, it has been completed, allowing our ships safe passage without the need to round Cape Horn. The canal, considered centuries ahead of its time, will not only serve as a gateway, but as a monument to the fact that nothing is impossible for [Root.Owner.GetName]."
 canal_events.28.t:0 "Canal in [From.Owner.GetName] Delayed"
 canal_events.28.d:0 "Our subject [From.Owner.GetName] has sent word that our canal construction has been delayed due to various factors beyond their control."
 canal_events.28.a:0 "Regrettable"
 canal_events.29.t:0 "Canal Project in [From.Owner.GetName] Ahead of Time"
 canal_events.29.d:0 "Our subject [From.Owner.GetName] has sent word that our canal construction is proceeding at a faster rate than expected due to their skilled handling of the project."
 canal_events.29.a:0 "Wonderful!"
 
 
 
 #Trade League Events#
 trade_league.1.t:0 "King of the Hill"
 trade_league.1.d:0 "Soldiers from a certain state are causing problems among the League's armed forces, refusing to honor requests from cities with which they have long-standing feuds. This has escalated into an informal power struggle within the military, for nothing but prestige and bragging rights, which could have consequences for morale."
 trade_league.1.a:0 "Have the troublemakers taste the whip, publicly."
 trade_league.1.b:0 "Boys will be boys."
 trade_league.2.t:0 "The Rich Get Richer"
 trade_league.2.d:0 "Some of the most successful merchants have been found to circumvent tariffs and League taxations by registering holdings under subordinate captains or by unregulated trade with foreign powers. While we still gain enough from them to make a profit, they're setting a bad example and many lesser merchants are likely to follow the practices if left unchecked."
 trade_league.2.a:0 "These titans of trade can be granted some leeway, lest we risk losing them."
 trade_league.2.b:0 "Everyone is equal before the law!"
 trade_league.3.t:0 "A Secret to Fast Travels"
 trade_league.3.d:0 "Overland transport of perishable goods is a hazardous enterprise, reliant on well-guarded routes. From a foreign contact you've learned of the location of a hidden path, allowing you to cut the time of certain transports by half. This could benefit all trade in the region, but could also be a terrific boon to yourself, should you choose not to share it."
 trade_league.3.a:0 "Competition breeds excellence."
 trade_league.3.b:0 "Sharing is caring."
 trade_league.4.t:0 "Pirates Smell Booty"
 trade_league.4.d:0 "Pirate and privateer raids have steadily increased in accordance with our profitability. Steps need to be taken to halt this escalation of seaborne robbery."
 trade_league.4.a:0 "Procure additional escorts."
 trade_league.4.b:0 "Invest in an effort to hunt the dogs down."
 trade_league.4.c:0 "Use a spy to infiltrate the largest pirate organization."
 trade_league.5.t:0 "Is A Pirate in Hand Worth Ten in the Gallows?"
 trade_league.5.d:0 "A pirate has been caught and is willing to trade information about the extensive criminal organization he is working for in exchange for a pardon."
 trade_league.5.a:0 "Grant the bargain and use it to catch the bigger fish."
 trade_league.5.b:0 "Show everyone what fate has in store for pirates!"
 trade_league.6.t:0 "Pirates for Everyone"
 trade_league.6.d:0 "The diligent actions of our navy have borne fruit. We've cornered and captured the leaders of the largest band of naval bandits plaguing our trade. While death by hanging is traditional, there might also be more lucrative ways to capitalize on the victory."
 trade_league.6.a:0 "Enlist them as privateers."
 trade_league.6.b:0 "All pirates must hang!"
 trade_league.7.t:0 "Ripe Lumber"
 trade_league.7.d:0 "An enterprising merchant has come across a huge shipment of unprocessed lumber at a very low price. While we could use the materials for our ships, there is the matter of their uncertain origins and whether the quality can be assured."
 trade_league.7.a:0 "If it floats, build boats!"
 trade_league.7.b:0 "Sell it before it becomes worthless."
 trade_league.8.t:0 "Let's Make War Our Business"
 trade_league.8.d:0 "Their enmity with a common rival unites several League members, and there is increased pressure from these states to assemble a common front towards this foe."
 trade_league.8.a:0 "The enemy of my friend is my enemy."
 trade_league.8.b:0 "We have subtler weapons at our disposal."
 trade_league.8.c:0 "Private squabbles do not dictate League policy."
 trade_league.9.t:0 "Envy Leads to Anger"
 trade_league.9.d:0 "We've received reports of ostracization and outright harassment of League merchants in a major trade city. Local merchants are accusing us of monopolizing trade, and are taking drastic measures."
 trade_league.9.a:0 "Demand compensation from the local authorities!"
 trade_league.9.b:0 "Let them see if they can do without us."
 trade_league.9.c:0 "Our representatives must learn to fend for themselves."
 trade_league.10.t:0 "Intraleague Friction"
 trade_league.10.d:0 "Two member cities of the League have a bloody history, but have until recently kept a lid on outright hostilities for the sake of League stability. The last year has seen the conflict rekindled, however, and cooperation between people from the different regions is becoming difficult."
 trade_league.10.a:0 "Side with one party."
 trade_league.10.b:0 "Side with the other party."
 trade_league.10.c:0 "If they cannot let go of their past, they need to resolve it on their own."
 trade_league.11.t:0 "Papers, Please!"
 trade_league.11.d:0 "A system where currency is measured in writing rather than coin promises to revolutionize the trade industry. Among the benefits are additional cargo space and a lessened incentive for pirates and robbers to ply their bloody trade. Whether this practice will remain inviolate to corruption and human error remains to be seen, though."
 trade_league.11.a:0 "We need every edge we can get."
 trade_league.11.b:0 "If it ain't broke..."
 trade_league.12.t:0 "No More Papers, Please!"
 trade_league.12.d:0 "Increasing use of bills of exchange and careful bookkeeping have produced many of the gains predicted. The practice comes with its own problems, however, as forgeries and audit frauds are running rampant."
 trade_league.12.a:0 "This is unacceptable. We should go back to silver."
 trade_league.12.b:0 "Mere teething problems. We will stay the course."
 trade_league.13.t:0 "Naval Envy"
 trade_league.13.d:0 "Despite our considerable mercantile success, we are not regarded as a serious power by many nations. If they won't respect wealth, maybe a massive warship will bring the respect we deserve."
 trade_league.13.a:0 "By God, it will be glorious!"
 trade_league.13.b:0 "We will not play their game."
 trade_league.14.t:0 "Spiritual Concerns"
 trade_league.14.d:0 "A papal envoy expresses concern for the religious unity of the League, with protestant and reformist sentiments running unchecked among members. He suggests letting the church send a religious advisor to oversee and report on the spiritual state of the League."
 trade_league.14.a:0 "Best not to anger the church."
 trade_league.14.b:0 "We answer to no one but the Free Market!"
