 estate_disasters.1.d:0 "$MONARCH$ has allowed the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ of $COUNTRY$ to grow too powerful and now they have made their move.

 estate_disasters.5.d:0 "$MONARCH$ has allowed the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ of $COUNTRY$ to grow too powerful and now they have made their move.

 estate_disasters.5.a:0 "We should have seen this coming..."

 estate_disasters.8.d:0 "After an arduous struggle the $ESTATE_NOMADIC_TRIBES$ have finally been brought in line again. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is now in control over enough land, men and institutions to once again call [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] the ruler of our people."
 estate_disasters.8.a:0 "The $MONARCHTITLE$ is back in control."
 estate_disasters.9.t:0 "The Dhimmi Break Free"
 estate_disasters.9.d:0 "$ESTATE_DHIMMI$ leaders have come to exercise such far-ranging authority over large areas of our state that it has now come to the point where the $MONARCHTITLE$ has had to accept that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] no longer has any practical control over them. With the crowning of a leader of their own the transition is complete and our loss of authority over the $ESTATE_DHIMMI$ total."
 estate_disasters.9.a:0 "We should have seen this coming..."
 estate_disasters.10.t:0 "The $ESTATE_COSSACKS$ Break Free"
 estate_disasters.10.d:0 "$MONARCH$ has allowed the $ESTATE_COSSACKS$ of $COUNTRY$ to grow too powerful and now they have made their move.
