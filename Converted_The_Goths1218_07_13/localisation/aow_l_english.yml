The crowd calls for the spilling of peasant and noble blood alike, and even some of the local clergy may not be trustworthy.\n\nThis abundance of satanic practices certainly goes a long way to explain the post-war hardships of [Root.GetName], but the mass trials that have followed are going out of hand.

While a sympathetic course of action, he has recently approached one of our ministers confessing that he has himself started to doubt Church doctrine. If this came to the Pope's knowledge, he would no longer be allowed to serve in the Curia, but perhaps we could convince him to keep this to himself for a few ducats."

 aow_events.46.d:0 "The cardinal we bribed to keep silent about his doubts of Church doctrine unfortunately still believed in confessing his sins. Even more unfortunately, the manner in which he did this to the Pope has not granted him forgiveness, perhaps because he does not truly regret his doubts. While he does regret taking our bribe, this too has come to the knowledge of the Holy Father, who is displeased with us as much as the now former cardinal."

In a letter to the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle], he has claimed that these people cannot be trusted and requested that they be subject to much more stringent regulations than our other citizens."

Unfortunately, his suggestions of centralizing power are not possible without removing some authority from the nobles, who have begun to see him as an opportunist. At this point, trying to remove him from office over this dispute would probably mean we lost his loyalty altogether, but the nobles who stand to lose from his plans consider this a sacrifice easily worth making."

 aow_events.51.d:0 "While conducting espionage in one of our neighboring countries, our operatives shadowed a powerful man, a cardinal, and discovered that although his loyalty appears incorruptible, his morals are already corrupt beyond what the Church can possibly imagine. Although the details of his transgressions are not of interest to us, they may be of interest to the Pope and give us a chance to weaken our neighbor's influence in the Curia. On the other hand, having a hold on a man of his rank could be useful in many situations."

Now it appears that foreign spies from [From.GetName] who have had their eye on him put an end to this and exposed his sins to the Pope. His days as a cardinal are numbered, and our power in the Curia will be weakened due to this untimely [From.GetAdjective] intervention."

 west_african.1.d:0 "Our people have come a long way from their origins. Where there were once many tribes with their own customs and leaders, people throughout [Root.GetName] now recognize [Root.Monarch.GetName] as their ruler. Many have speculated that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] may soon declare [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] Sultan, but this may not go without contention unless the title is given to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] by the Caliph.\n\nWord has reached us that the Ottoman Caliphate has its seat in the distant city of Istanbul and they may just be willing to grant us an audience. Perhaps with the Caliph's blessing, the Sultanate of [Root.GetName] will find support among the faithful of its citizens."
 west_african.1.a:0 "Let us travel to this faraway land and seek their support!"
 west_african.1.b:0 "We do not need their approval to reign!"

 west_african.2.d:0 "An emissary has arrived from the lands of [From.GetName], seeking support from [Root.Monarch.GetName] in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] capacity as Caliph for the creation of a new sultanate. Once a collection of disparate tribes, we are informed that the [From.GetAdjective] people are now pious Muslims and devoted to their ruler, [From.Monarch.GetName], who wishes to seize the title of Sultan with our support."
 west_african.2.a:0 "A noble goal. The foundation of a new sultanate is a blessing to us as well."
 west_african.2.b:0 "If you wish to be Sultan, you must convince the people yourself."
 west_african.3.t:0 "Caliph Approves of Sultanate"
 west_african.3.d:0 "The emissary has returned from Istanbul, bringing news of how the leader of the Muslim world has decreed that [Root.Monarch.GetName] is now the Sultan of [Root.GetName].

 west_african.4.t:0 "Caliph Disapproves of Sultanate"
 west_african.4.d:0 "The emissary has returned from Istanbul, but despite our best efforts, the Caliph would not grant us the title. According to [From.Monarch.GetHerHim], it is up to us to convince the people of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s capacity to rule as Sultan."
 west_african.4.a:0 "A Caliph displaying such poor judgment is hardly fit for the title."
 west_african.5.t:0 "People of the Desert"
 west_african.5.d:0 "The [Root.Owner.GetAdjective] people have lived in this arid climate for a long time. Although this causes some foolish nations to dismiss us as inhabiting the land unwanted by others, we have mastered skills of survival and combat that they would be wise to fear.\n\nJust across the border at [Root.GetName], our brethren are suffering the oppression of other people, people who may not be prepared for what the [Root.Culture.GetName] are capable of when you underestimate them. With the help of these locals, we could organize a raid into the lands of their oppressors, striking quickly and taking advantage of the fact that we know the desert there better than anyone else."
 west_african.5.a:0 "We will arrive and withdraw like a sandstorm."
 west_african.5.b:0 "We will not assault our neighbors like this, regardless of who their subjects are."
 west_african.6.t:0 "Desert Raiders"
 west_african.6.d:0 "Some people from the [Root.Culture.GetName] elite have recently been attacked by what they believe to be a raid organized by foreign military. Initially, the attack seemed to have occurred too deep into our borders for this to be possible, but an explanation for how this could have happened has begun to take shape. The [From.Culture.GetName] in one of our border provinces, who we thought to be our loyal subjects, appear to have conspired with our neighbors to organize the attack.\n\nWhile it may not be possible to retaliate in kind, there are other ways we can show what we think of such cowardly tactics."
 west_african.6.a:0 "Sooner or later, they will pay."
 west_african.7.t:0 "A Safer Border"
 west_african.7.d:0 "A long time has passed, but we have not forgotten how [Root.GetName] once served as an entry point for an audacious attack to plunder our country. Many people believe that this threat remains real, and demands that the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] act upon it, strengthening our control of the border and ensuring that desert raiders are not allowed to cross it ever again."
 west_african.7.a:0 "We will dispatch the necessary troops immediately."
 west_african.7.b:0 "The [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] will travel to patrol the border [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself]!"

 west_african.8.t:0 "Wasteland to Some"
 west_african.8.d:0 "The [Root.Culture.GetName] people have always been resourceful and adaptive beyond what others would consider possible, and lands others may find impossible to inhabit or even traverse are our homes, our roads and our domain. We could made good use of this, including in our country's trade efforts. One of our main trade routes is in fact right next to such an area, and there have been discussions about how to best take advantage of this."
 west_african.8.a:0 "We can send our caravans on routes that we alone know."
 west_african.8.b:0 "It can be used as a base to stage an attack on the trade route."
 west_african.9.t:0 "Idolatry or Reverence?"
 west_african.9.d:0 "Our efforts to bring salvation to the heathens in [Root.GetName] have borne fruit, but it is a strange and unfamiliar fruit. The local population has started to accept Christ, but the faith has been intertwined with their old ways. Angels and spirits, the true Lord and the old Lord of the Sky, the Blessed Virgin and the Earth Goddess... do these people really believe in what they hear, or do they simply call their old idols by different names? The local missionary has come to us for advice, concerned about the souls of the [Root.Owner.GetAdjective] people, and his own."
 west_african.9.a:0 "Their faith is pure, and we would be fools to reject it."
 west_african.9.b:0 "This is worse than heresy. It must be rooted out."
 west_african.10.t:0 "God of the Sky"
 west_african.10.d:0 "We trust in the spirits, in the gods that have always been with us, and our people are rarely impressed by the lies of those who would lead us from them. However, some people on our border who have come into contact with those who worship one they claim returned from the dead seem to have seen similarities between their faith and ours. Just as many here choose to worship the Sky Father, our neighbors speak of the one the call Christ as having a Heavenly Father himself. Many have begun to suggest that these two may be one and the same, and that the animosity between our faiths is nothing but a misunderstanding."
 west_african.10.a:0 "This is simply another lie they spread to force their faith upon us."
 west_african.10.b:0 "We have different names for many other things, so why not gods?"
 west_african.11.t:0 "Tradition or Haram?"
 west_african.11.d:0 "Bringing the word of the Prophet to the people of [Root.GetName] has not been impossible, but the outcome so far has troubled some of our religious scholars. Although they have abadoned many pagan traditions, a reverence for ancestors remains with troubling undertones of worship. We see no fault in honoring one's family, but when prayers are directed to the dead and not to God, can anything good really come of it? Nevertheless, these are ancient practices. Rejecting them may alienate many of those who would otherwise listen."
 west_african.11.a:0 "We will respect their practices as equal to our own."
 west_african.11.b:0 "There is no God but God. If they will not learn this, we have achieved nothing."
 west_african.12.t:0 "Many Spirits, One God"
 west_african.12.d:0 "We have known of the Muslim faith for a long time, but chosen to remain true to our traditions. Those who devote themselves only to the distant creator, forsaking the gods and spirits that dwell among us, are certainly on the path to misfortune.\n\nPeople at the border, who live next to Muslims every day, have started to see things differently. They find that the words of Muhammad speak to them as well as their neighbors and rather than seeing this as a betrayal of the old ways, they identify the prophet's God with our most revered sky deity."
 west_african.12.a:0 "Your ancestors go forgotten while you pray to the sky. This is unacceptable."
 west_african.12.b:0 "Perhaps if we accept their one God, they will consider our many."
 west_african.13.t:0 "No Compromises in Faith"
 west_african.13.d:0 "Although many of our citizens are not yet followers of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith, we have remained hopeful and patient. Others are not so patient. Many of our citizens consider it absurd that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], ruling by the grace of God, accepts the widespread paganism in our country. This, in turn, has sparked concern among the very same pagans that they are subjects of an externally imposed belief system, with some of them calling for the overthrow of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] if [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] does not show reverence for the spiritual practices that have lived with the people here for millennia."
 west_african.13.a:0 "The believers are right. We will not tolerate this godlessness."
 west_african.13.b:0 "The animists, although misguided, must be respected as citizens."

 west_african.15.d:0 "The scholars and scientists among the [Root.GetAdjective] have been distinguished by extraordinary innovation and curiosity. Their latest efforts have focused on gathering information about the plant life of the large jungle areas of our land, hoping to gain useful information to aid in researching medicine and dyeing techniques. This has been successful so far, with the botany project rippling developments into other areas of research."
 west_african.15.a:0 "And much is yet to be discovered."
 west_african.16.t:0 "The Weapons of our Neighbors"
 west_african.16.d:0 "Although we do not doubt the strength and tenacity of our [Root.GetAdjective] warriors, the technological advances of the neighboring armies have not passed by without our notice. The adoption of firearms greatly changes warfare, and we can see clear advantages in this.\n\nOur neighbors are unlikely to provide us with all the technical details to fully equip our army, but they do seem willing to sell us some of their weapons. While this would probably give them an advantage in terms of our trade exchanges, it would doubtlessly be of use to our military efforts."
 west_african.16.a:0 "We must acquire this equipment at any cost."
 west_african.16.b:0 "Our army serves its purpose, with or without these weapons."
 west_african.17.t:0 "Transatlantic Slave Trade"
 west_african.17.d:0 "[Root.GetName] is far from the only country keeping slaves, with this being a common fate for war captives in the area. Our European neighbors seem to have especially interested in this lately, seemingly being in desperate need for servants to work the new land they have seized across the ocean. To this end, they are now attempting to arrange a long-term trade agreement with us that will facilitate this purchase of slaves.\n\nWhile we stand to earn money from this, the implications have been the cause of some concern. They apparently consider our people, or at least our captives, to be suitable as their slaves and treat them with unbounded brutality. We don't wish to humor this notion, but there is no telling what they might end up doing if we refuse."
 west_african.17.a:0 "None will be sold to these people if we can help it."
 west_african.17.b:0 "If they can pay, we can provide."
 west_african.17.c:0 "It's time to put an end to the practice of slavery, for us as well as for them."
 west_african.18.t:0 "Once Nomads"
 west_african.18.d:0 "The [Root.Culture.GetName] people of [Root.GetName] have traditionally lived, at least in part, a nomadic life. Although our efforts to centralize have made this less feasible, people are used to it and expect us not to intervene. It does make [Root.Owner.GetName] more difficult to manage, however. Some of the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle]'s advisors have suggested that we try to take control and restrict their movements, but this could be seen as trampling the way of life that made them successful in the first place."
 west_african.18.a:0 "Let them live as they always did."
 west_african.18.b:0 "[Root.GetName] is unruly enough as it is."
 west_african.19.t:0 "The Ashanti"
 west_african.19.d:0 "The Akan people of Kumasi and the surrounding region have lived there for a long time now, although we have not considered them a nation in their own right. However, their tribe is of such importance to our present affairs that we need to conduct trade and diplomacy with them. Although the nature of the Akan state may yet change, we cannot question its existence."
 west_african.19.a:0 "Who knows, one day they may become grow to the strength of an empire."
 west_african.20.t:0 "Sika 'dwa: The Golden Stool"
 west_african.20.d:0 "The Ashanti have neighbored one of colonies for some time, so far without any major diplomatic incidents. This all changed recently, when our governor $COLONIALGOVERNOR$, our representative at the Gold Coast, heard of the Golden Stool. This mysterious old artifact apparently holds great significance to the Ashanti, to whom it is the seat of the king. Although we have been vaguely aware of its existence before, it recently came to the knowledge of $COLONIALGOVERNOR$, who demands to sit on it as a demonstration of his, and by extension our, paramount power in the area. \n\n'Why am I not sitting on the Golden Stool at this moment?' he has asked the Ashanti, who have so far shown no sign of complying. Indeed, they seem highly insulted by the suggestion alone. How far should we be willing to pursue this?"
 west_african.20.a:0 "As far as it takes!"
 west_african.20.a.tt:0 "The Ashanti may not take kindly to this."
 west_african.20.b:0 "We have no use for a man who demands such means to assert his dominance."
 west_african.21.t:0 "War of the Golden Stool"
 west_african.21.d:0 "The Golden Stool is the symbol of the Ashanti king, which no one is allowed to violate. Now, the [From.GetAdjective], who we trusted had some respect for our traditions despite their disinterest in them, have sent a governor here who demands to sit upon the Stool as if he was king himself. This has outraged the Queen Mother and many others, who are arguing that this man must be stopped and the sanctity of the Golden Stool preserved, at the cost of war if necessary."
 west_african.21.a:0 "If [From.GetName] trusts such a fool to represent them, there can only be war."
 west_african.21.b:0 "Traditions are not worth starting a war over."
 west_african.22.t:0 "Self-rule for the [Root.Culture.GetName]"
 west_african.22.d:0 "The [Root.Owner.Culture.GetName] rule [Root.Owner.GetName] justly, we believe. [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] has been fair to the different tribes under our rule, but to some of [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] subjects, this is not enough. The [Root.Culture.GetName] people have sent a representative from [Root.GetName], requesting greater rights to make decisions about their own tribes if they are to remain under the reign of the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle]. Although seemingly a humble request, the news of discontent in their home provinces makes it sound more like a demand."
 west_african.22.a:0 "The tribes are best ruled that rule themselves."
 west_african.22.b:0 "We don't give into demands, even if veiled."
 west_african.23.t:0 "Raids Through the Jungle"
 west_african.23.d:0 "Ever since our adoption of cavalry, the mounted warriors of [Root.GetName] have been feared by all for their uncanny ability to rapidly attack deep inside enemy territory, raiding and weakening the defenses. A group of soldiers have prepared a plan to aid the ongoing war based on this tactic, preparing to break off from the main army and perform the attack in secret, before the enemy can react. Although a risky plan, it could yield much-needed funds for the war."

 west_african.24.t:0 "Into the Unknown"
 west_african.24.d:0 "The uncharted territory within and beyond the jungles at our border may seem threatening to many other people. But our tribe has lived in lands like these for a long time, and would never have thrived if we feared exploring the unknown. Now, a large group of young hunters are asking for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s permission to explore and settle in whatever place they may discover. Certainly, these are capable people who could get a lot done if they didn't waste time on dreams of places not yet known, but who are we to put a stop to youthful curiosity?"

 west_african.25.t:0 "New Dyes"
 west_african.25.d:0 "Our research into the plant life of [Root.GetName] continues to lead to new discoveries. We have recently uncovered a new way to create dyes, which is both efficient and results in impressive colors not found anywhere else that we know of. Since dyes is one of the important [Root.GetAdjective] exports, we will see that these valuable techniques are spread quickly throughout our land."
 west_african.25.a:0 "We are dyeing to try them out!"
 west_african.26.t:0 "The Spirits Remain"
 west_african.26.d:0 "Many foreign religions have attempted to set their roots among us and many missionaries have tried to turn us towards a God, always the one God, always the same, always different, always theirs. But despite the trying times we have gone through, we keep honoring the spirits and our ancestors. Now the elders have told us that the time is right for a larger celebration of these ancient rites and that people throughout [Root.GetName] should be encouraged to participate.\n\nWith the very people who would see us converted right across the border, this sort of nationwide event would probably attract some irritation from those who consider themselves above it. Our diplomats are suggesting we keep it at a smaller scale, so as to not offend our neighbors."
