 religious_events.15.d:0 "The philosophical ideas of Neo-Confucian thinker Chu Hsi regarding knowledge and action, with heavy emphasis on logical reasoning and coherence, have been brought to our attention once again by the works of Wang Yangming.

 religious_events.16.t:0 "Opposition to [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 religious_events.16.d:0 "The sizeable Muslim community of [Root.GetName] has been raising objections to the coronation of [Root.Monarch.GetName]. As the old Muslim aristocrats and clergy remain very influential in our country and still hold many positions of power within our state this is not a small problem. It has been suggested that perhaps the situation might be defused by [Root.Monarch.GetName] abdicating in favor of a relative who would then convert to Islam. This would allow power to remain with the [Root.Dynasty.GetName] family while still placating the Ulema and leading aristocrats. Should [Root.Monarch.GetName] to continue to govern our country we may find that these elements within our state are likely to attempt to enthrone a candidate of their own with more favorable attitudes towards Islam."

 protestantism_events.1.t:0 "Reformer Seeks Safe Haven"
 protestantism_events.1.d:0 "Fearing for his safety one of the great theologians of our age has had to leave his homeland. As a Protestant country it is our duty to offer a safe haven for this man and doing so would undoubtedly strengthen the position of our State Church. At least as long as this reformer agrees with our policies."
 protestantism_events.1.a:0 "Let us welcome this great man!"
 protestantism_events.1.a.tt:0 "For as long as the Reformer lives within our borders he may chose to criticize or condone the policies of our State Church."

 desc_harbouring_reformer:0 "We have allowed one of the more active Theologians of the Reformation to take up residence in our country, lending his great name and works to our State Church."
 protestantism_events.2.t:0 "Reformer seeks refuge in [From.GetName]"
 protestantism_events.2.d:0 "One of the most prominent proponents of the Reformation in our country has left for [From.GetName] claiming to fear persecution from the Catholic authorities here. Not content to simply leave the man now spends his time producing pamphlets to deride not only the Catholic church but also his old homeland."
 protestantism_events.2.a:0 "Outrageous!"
 protestantism_events.3.t:0 "Reformer seen to criticise State Church"
 protestantism_events.3.d:0 "Having a strong-willed Reformer within our borders has not been entirely without friction. It would seem that a man who has already forsaken his home country can be quite unwilling to moderate his views to fit the policies of his new home."
 protestantism_events.3.a:0 "Living under our protection means supporting the Church!"
 protestantism_events.3.b:0 "Well if you feel that strongly about it..."
 protestantism_events.4.t:0 "State Church Condemned!"
 protestantism_events.4.d:0 "Disappointed with our inability to fully embrace the Reformation the foreign reformer has departed for to the lands of a more inclined prince. In the long run this may strengthen our church but pamphlets have already begun circulating about the falseness of the Church of [Root.GetName]."
 protestantism_events.4.a:0 "Ok."
 protestantism_events.5.t:0 "Criticism Withdrawn"
 protestantism_events.5.d:0 "A sharp reprimand was all it took. The minor crisis in the relations of our state church has blown over and the troubling voices of criticism are quiet."
 protestantism_events.5.a:0 "Great!"
 protestantism_events.6.t:0 "The Fear of Crypto-Catholics"
 protestantism_events.6.d:0 "Ever present in our state is the fear that some who professes to believe in all aspects of our state church are still secretly a Catholic sympathizer. One noble family in particular, though firmly entrenched in the machinery of the state, is said to have Papist leanings. As the years drag on these rumors refuse to die and would now seem almost impossible for us to ignore."
 protestantism_events.6.a:0 "Restrict this family from holding offices."

 protestantism_events.6.c:0 "Ignore these vile rumors."
 catholics_in_hiding:0 "Persecution of Crypto-Catholics"
 desc_catholics_in_hiding:0 "Our policy of active persecution of suspected Crypto-Catholics in the administration has cut down on the willingness to criticize our State Church but also means that some steer clear entirely from seeking a career in the service of the state."
 rumored_crypto_catholics:0 "Fear of Crypto-Catholics"
 desc_rumored_crypto_catholics:0 "Our unwillingness to investigate rumors of Crypto-Catholics secretly trying to subvert the state has fueled various conspiracy theories in the countryside."
 protestantism_events.7.t:0 "'The Last Days' of [Root.GetName]"
 protestantism_events.7.d:0 "Religious fervor has gripped [Root.GetName] as the population have become convinced the end of days is drawing nearer. Peasants are talking of signs in the sky and contrary to the doctrine of the State Church local priests are giving sermons on the apocalypse. As Millenarianism sweeps the province blame is being put on the State and State Church itself which professes to be Protestant yet clearly is not living up to its name.\nOfficial reactions have so far been very weak as even among the clergy of [Root.Owner.Capital.GetCapitalName] some feel these fears are justified."
 protestantism_events.7.a:0 "Try to calm the situation down."

 desc_fear_of_god:0 "'We know by scripture, and all learned men affirm the same, that the world was meant to endure 6000 years'.\nMany in our country feel that the end of days is drawing nearer and our State Church is doing what it can to capitalize on this belief. While we run the risk of fueling Millenarian anti-establishment forces in our country the vast majority focuses on ensuring the safety of their own souls."
 protestantism_events.8.t:0 "Avarice"
 protestantism_events.8.d:0 "Some members of our State Church has suffered dearly due to excessively high interest rates, voices are being raised and pamphlets circulated condemning 'Usury and Fraud' and claiming that petty brokers are to be seen in every street.\nIt is the view of our State and its Church that charging interest is compatible with being a good Christian yet in some cases it seems it can lead to excesses. Perhaps it would be best to further decrease the allowed amount of interest to curb the worst cases."

 protestantism_events.8.b:0 "Let us decrease the interest limit for a while."
 prot_economic_downturn:0 "Economic Downturn"

 desc_stricter_usury_regulations:0 "In order to curb the worst excesses of allowing interest to be charged for lending money we have changed the maximum allowed amount of interest slightly."
 protestantism_events.9.t:0 "Message for the Faithful"
 protestantism_events.9.d:0 "One of the great Strengths of having a State Church is the ability to reach out to all the faithful in our country at once. A national day of prayer is coming up and it is customary for the Sermon this day to be partly dictated by the central State Church. What should the sermon focus on during the years ahead?"
 protestantism_events.9.a:0 "Gratefulness for the Peace we now enjoy."

 desc_prot_christian_unity:0 "We have used the national prayer day sermon to make our subjects understand the great value of bonding together with Christendom as a whole against the infidels."
 protestantism_events.10.t:0 "Resistance to the Reformation in [Root.GetName]"
 protestantism_events.10.d:0 "There are still those, especially in the countryside who oppose the State Church of [Root.Owner.GetName] and who long to return to the embrace of the Roman Church. There is however a big difference between religious doubts and open rebellion and so far things have been quiet in [Root.GetName]. The State Church has in turn been content to leave most of these people alone as long as they attend services and pay their taxes.\nIt seems this peace was not meant to last. The recent collection of Church Silver in the area has been regarded as an open declaration of war by the local population and they are now taking up arms to protect their Churches from the greedy hands of [Root.Owner.Capital.GetCapitalName]."
 protestantism_events.10.a:0 "Time for some forceful persuasion."
 protestantism_events.10.b:0 "Exempt this area for now."
 protestantism_events.11.t:0 "$THEOLOGIAN$ denounces the Church of [Root.GetName]"
 protestantism_events.11.d:0 "$THEOLOGIAN$ had a promising career long before the reformation reached our country and the state Church of [Root.GetName] was created. As an influential person with firmly grounded ideas, $THEOLOGIAN$ has been hard to convince to embrace the new nature of the Church. This resistance to change has only grown bigger over the years and now $THEOLOGIAN$ is seen to be openly opposed to the Church. A member of the court cannot be seen to openly oppose [Root.Monarch.GetName] like this, something must be done!"

 protestantism_events.11.c:0 "This is unfortunate."
 protestantism_events.12.t:0 "Catholic Thinker at Court"
 protestantism_events.12.d:0 "$NATURAL_SCIENTIST$$PHILOSOPHER$ is famous for $NATURAL_SCIENTIST_POSS_PRONOUN$$PHILOSOPHER_POSS_PRONOUN$ sharp intellect and $NATURAL_SCIENTIST_POSS_PRONOUN$$PHILOSOPHER_POSS_PRONOUN$ presence in our court lends a certain grandeur to our name. $NATURAL_SCIENTIST_CAP_ADJ$$PHILOSOPHER_CAP_ADJ$ is however also a firm Catholic and has been allowed to practice $NATURAL_SCIENTIST_POSS_PRONOUN$$PHILOSOPHER_POSS_PRONOUN$ faith as he wishes in order to come here. It would be unthinkable for the Church of [Root.GetName] itself to criticize [Root.Monarch.GetName] but in the streets of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] there is talk of $NATURAL_SCIENTIST$$PHILOSOPHER$ trying to plant subversive Catholic ideas in the head of [Root.Monarch.GetName]."
 protestantism_events.12.a:0 "Let them talk."

 protestantism_events.13.d:0 "It is rumored that $TREASURER$$PHILOSOPHER$$ARTIST$$THEOLOGIAN$$MASTER_OF_MINT$$INQUISITOR$, a close advisor of [Root.Monarch.GetName], is in fact harboring hidden Calvinist leanings. A number of recent laws have been accused of secretly trying to bring our country closer to the ideals of the Reformed churches."

 protestantism_events.14.d:0 "The teachers of [Root.Heir.GetName] all find [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] to be an exceptionally promising future ruler. In all ways relating to statecraft [Root.Heir.GetName] has shown [Root.Heir.GetHerselfHimself] to be both interested and talented. However the religious authorities have come to worry that [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] has taken a much too large interest in the Catholic faith we have left behind."

 protestantism_events.15.d:0 "It is no secret that [Root.Monarch.GetName] has a great understanding of the Catholic faith, perhaps much more so than the clergy in our State Church would wish. Nonetheless [Root.Monarch.HerHis] coronation has been a popular event and the people seem to be behind our new ruler. Undoubtedly an understanding of foreign faiths may be of good use to a ruler of a Protestant Kingdom and few would dare accuse [Root.Monarch.GetName] of Crypto-Catholicism."

 desc_tolerant_monarch:0 "Our ruler is known for a great understanding of other faiths and religious minorities in our reign enjoy privileges they otherwise would not because of it."
 protestantism_events.16.t:0 "Conscience of [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 protestantism_events.16.d:0 "Years have passed and [Root.Monarch.GetName] has proven to be a fair and just ruler. The clergy no longer fear a sudden Catholic coup and their hatred of Papism has been tempered by [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s understanding of the religion.\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] however is troubled. As the years have gone by [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has come to realize that [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] personal faith lies much closer to the Catholics that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has done so much to protect and not with the dogmatic State Church of [Root.GetName]"

 protestantism_events.17.d:0 "[Root.Heir.GetName]'s interest in Catholicism seems only to have grown over the years and [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] now surrounds [Root.Heir.GetHerselfHimself] with philosophers, scientists and artists from the Catholic world. This has grown into something of an embarrassment. As head of the [Root.GetName] Church it is the duty of [Root.Monarch.GetName] to uphold the values of the reformation. Unless [Root.Heir.GetName] can be convinced to change [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] the authority of our Church may suffer."

The road ahead is by no means going to be an easy one but nobody is as convinced as [Root.Monarch.GetName] that all will go well."

 protestantism_events.20.d:0 "Despite trying to make the expectations on a royal Heir as clear as possible [Root.Heir.GetName] insists in upholding [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] harmful fascination with the Catholic Church. In the capital propagandists and satirists have already begun distributing pamphlets about the fact that [Root.Monarch.GetName] cannot seem to control his own kin, let alone protect the faithful of the kingdom."

 protestantism_events.21.d:0 "$THEOLOGIAN$$INQUISITOR$ has had an exemplary career, starting as a low level local priest and finally reaching the very top of the Church hierarchy and has over the years come to be regarded as a pillar of the Church of [Root.GetName]. It is therefore very troubling that $THEOLOGIAN$$INQUISITOR$ have begun to take issue with the direction the Church is heading. While $THEOLOGIAN$$INQUISITOR$ has steered clear of directly criticizing [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] it is hard for anyone to take $THEOLOGIAN_POSS_PRONOUN$$INQUISITOR_POSS_PRONOUN$ words as anything but harmful for the State Church."

 protestantism_events.22.t:0 "The Lingering Hope of Reconciliation"
 protestantism_events.22.d:0 "There are still those who long for the time when the Christian faith was unified. While they see the Reformation and the birth of Protestantism as necessary they also lament that it couldn't be done without a schism.\nWhile well intended these kind of leanings can be very harmful to a State Church such as ours and it is therefore a matter of some concern that it seems a number of the officials in our Church as well as some at some of our Seminar are entertaining such ideas."

 protestantism_events.23.t:0 "Protestant Diaspora"
 protestantism_events.23.d:0 "As Christendom grows ever more divided the trickle of religious refugees has grown into a steady stream. Religious conflicts in major Catholic states have caused many Protestant to leave their old home countries. As a Protestant country with our own Church we would be able to offer them protection and we could also make good use of their skills and assets.\nProtestantism is however far from a unified faith and it is not very likely that all those who come to us will find the Church of [Root.GetName] to match their own beliefs fully. While it would be admirable to receive all Protestant Immigrants it might be more prudent to hand pick those that possess skills we could make good use of."

 protestantism_events.24.t:0 "Criticism of Official Bible"
 protestantism_events.24.d:0 "Having a Bible Translation sanctioned by the state has done much to unify the Protestant faith in our country and it is the opinion of both the general public and most theologians that our translation has resulted in a book far more true to the origins of our religion.\nThere are however also some who find the official Bible translation very lacking. Some groups claim that it is simply outdated and in need of modernization, some that it is too favorable to the ruling state and that we have attempted to make use of it to pacify our subjects. Others again simply see it as not going far enough and still maintain many of the errors that have accumulated over the years in previous versions of the Bible."

It is however impossible for a single translation to satisfy all of those that previously used their own various Bible translations and it seems groups from all over the religious spectra has managed to find some passage they object to. Nonetheless we have elected to stick by our version, confident that it will outlast them all in the end."

 protestantism_events.25.d:0 "It is no secret that the marriage of [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] spouse isn't the most loving union and producing an heir has turned out to be quite problematic. It is rumored that [Root.Monarch.GetName] has had a number of extra marital affairs and the reputation of our Kingdom is running the risk of becoming tarnished. [Root.Monarch.GetName] will not hear of a word about divorce however and considers such a thing deeply immoral.\nInstead [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] argues that if bigamy could work for the patriarchs then perhaps that could be used as a precedent for allowing [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] a second union.

To join the Christian elite, being part of a powerful family is rarely enough – everyone who has a significant role in the running of our country has been educated at one of the most prestigious monastic schools.\n\nWe have been contacted by two of these schools and they are asking for our support.

 coptic_flavor.28.d:0 "Today, fifty days after Easter, we observe Pentecost. On this sacred day, many centuries ago, our Church was born. The Holy Spirit descended upon the Apostles and the other followers of Christ as tongues of fire. Thus they spoke the word of the Lord in all the world's languages and converted thousands of souls to the true faith. Hereby began a new era, the messianic age of the Kingdom of God. In memory of this great event we hold one of the Church's largest celebrations. Together we read from the Bible, sing joyous hymns and kneel in prayer."

 coptic_flavor.29.d:0 "As Copts we celebrate Palm Sunday which is one of the Seven Major Lord's Feasts. On the seventh Sunday of the Great Lent we commemorate and relive Jesus’ triumphal entry into the holy city of Jerusalem. It is on this day that He drove away the merchants and moneychangers from the Temple. The crowd who cheeringly greeted the Messiah were waving palm branches over their heads and so do we as we make our way through the church on this happy day. During the procession we chant the joyful hymns and it is truly one of our favorite times during the Church year."

'I shall follow in the footsteps of Saint Shenoute the Archimandrite – one day I might even found a monastery of my own!' he exclaims passionately.\nNot everyone would agree with the nobleman's decision however and even though he has already started giving away his belongings, there might still be time to talk the man out of going."
 coptic_flavor.30.a:0 "We could use that passion in some of our provinces..."

 coptic_flavor.43.dc:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] are insulted by our thinly veiled threat against their Patriarch of [cairo_province.GetName]. The response from their rulers contains a belligerent warning of touching the hair of a single Copt."
 coptic_flavor.43.c:0 "We expected as much."
 coptic_flavor.43.dd:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] have sent no messages in response to our thinly veiled threats against their Patriarch of [cairo_province.GetName]. Either they do not care about their holy site, or they are too scared of the glorious [Root.GetName] to speak against us."

 coptic_flavor.33.d:0 "We are proud to be Copts, followers of the true faith.

The impending war is not a matter of if, it is a matter of when. Before it breaks out we should try to seek out some powerful allies. There is a mighty Christian realm far to the north, but its exact location and the distance to their lands are unknown to us. However we can fund an expedition with the goal of finding them."

They claim to come from the great [sent_diplomats.GovernmentName] of [sent_diplomats.GetName] and that they seek friends among their fellow Christians. We have very little knowledge of the Christians in the south, but these [sent_diplomats.GetAdjective] men seem to be genuine believers. They speak of Christ with fervor in their voice and seem far more well-versed in the scripture than our average noble. Apparently their country is surrounded by religious enemies and they ask us to aid them in defending the true faith. While this conflict is too distant and unknown for us to get engaged directly, we could share some of our knowledge and resources with them."

While many of the Christians they encountered listened, few seemed to truly care. In our isolation, we are doubly cursed – not only are we surrounded by enemies, the distance to the rest of the Christian community makes us outcasts. What happens in [Root.GetName] does not influence them and perhaps our ways are too foreign for them to relate to. It seems as if the Copts are alone in the world."

 muslim_dlc.EVTDESC14:0 "Known for its emphasis on love, tolerance, and openness, the Chishti Order has spread to the provinces of $COUNTRY$ and their welcoming attitude to seekers who belong to other religions may prove a way to convert more people to Islam. They are rather strict in their belief that a Chishti teacher should not attend the court or be involved in matters of state, as this will corrupt the soul with worldly matters. Some Muslims believe that music is haram, forbidden, while the practitioners of Chishti believe that song or listening to music can evoke the divine presence."

The struggle against the desires of the ego is emphasized by the Qadiriyya's teachings. The two stages of the greater struggle are firstly deeds forbidden by religious law and second against fundamental vices such as greed, vanity, and fear.

It is considered the infallible law of God and there are two sources of the law. The first is the precepts set forth in the Qur'an, and the example set by the prophet Muhammad in the Sunnah. Qadis and imams are complaining about the lax maintenance of the Sharia law in $COUNTRY$ and insist that the $MONARCHTITLE$ make sure that the law is enforced, at all times."

Our Minister will no longer have anything to do with us and reminds us that a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] that cannot uphold the rightful laws will attract nothing but liars and informers to [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] government."
 buddhism_events.1.a:0 "Good Riddance!"
 buddhism_events.2.t:0 "[Root.GetName] Monasteries deteriorating"
 buddhism_events.2.d:0 "Due to a combination of lacking monastic discipline and a faltering economy many of the great monasteries of [Root.GetName] have seen their membership dwindling over the last few years. A concerned Bhikkhu has approached the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] with a warning that unless something is done soon the dire situation may lead to the last few monks abandoning their vows or seeking to join monasteries elsewhere, leaving [Root.GetName] impoverished both spiritually and economically. There are however many local landowners more than ready to infringe on the land an empty monastery would leave behind. As the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] is meant to protect Monastic life in [Root.Owner.GetName] it will be clear to many observers that the responsibility for whatever happens will rest on [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] shoulders."
 buddhism_events.2.a:0 "We must do all we can!"
 buddhism_events.2.b:0 "Perhaps now the land will come to better use."
 buddhism_events.3.t:0 "Monastic Vows Broken"
 buddhism_events.3.d:0 "The religious discipline of the monks of [Root.GetName] is faltering. As a result of lacking funds, monopolization of higher monastic positions by a small group of the aristocracy and a [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] unable to protect the faithful in the way expected of a true Buddhist ruler more and more monks seem to be breaking their vows to abandon monastic life, or in some cases maintaining it while not honoring its principles. A particularly glaring case of a monk breaking his vows and inciting others do to the same has recently come to our attention and many will likely read a great deal into the way we choose to deal with this. While a good ruler should always show mercy and gentleness it is also the duty of any ruler to uphold the discipline of the monasteries, with force if needed."
 buddhism_events.3.a:0 "We must show gentleness."
 buddhism_events.3.b:0 "Fine errant monks all movable property and livestock."
 buddhism_events.3.c:0 "Execute the monk and anyone who stands by him!"
 buddhism_events.4.t:0 "Monastic Orders Support Pretender"
 buddhism_events.4.d:0 "As it is the monarch's duty to protect the monastic institutions it is those institutions duty to protect the country against bad ruelrs. Due to what they feel is lacking attentiveness to the duties of a monarch and inability and disinterest in upholding and protecting the common good in general and the monastic organizations of our country in particular some of the more powerful monasteries have openly come out in support of a distant relative to our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 buddhism_events.4.a:0 "This is an outrage!"
 buddhism_events.5.t:0 "Precedent of [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 buddhism_events.5.d:0 "A recent ruling by [Root.Monarch.GetName] was considered so just and well argued that it has been used as an example to strive for in similar cases in a recently created addendum to a collection of the Pali laws of [Root.GetName]. As [Root.Monarch.GetName] has become known for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] stringent and constant to adhere to the virtues of the Rajadhamma this is not the first time [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] rule has been put forward as a good example."

 buddhism_events.7.d:0 "A white elephant has been captured in the hinterlands of [From.GetName] and [From.Monarch.GetName] has wisely interpreted this as a sign of the productive alliance of our two peoples. This is the greatest gift a ruler could possibly bestow upon us and will likely be regarded very well by our population. It will however also be quite costly to take care of this rare beast even though we could hardly refuse to do so."
 buddhism_events.8.t:0 "Monasteries of [Root.GetName]"
 buddhism_events.8.d:0 "The wise and productive policies of [Root.Monarch.GetName] in regards to the monasteries of the realm have always been well considered and benevolent. No Monastery is allowed to go poor yet the discipline and strength of the institutions themselves have not been allowed to deteriorate. As a result the monasteries of [Root.GetName] are blooming and our state has become known everywhere as an example to follow."
 buddhism_events.8.a:0 "Demand that they help develop the province."

 buddhism_events.9.t:0 "The Horrors of War"
 buddhism_events.9.d:0 "Not all men are cut out to lead a life of war and it seems the conflict our country is currently in has made some of them realize it. The number of deserters seeking to hide behind the walls of the monasteries is not big but they set a dangerous example. As a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] it is however our duty to protect the monasteries and while we have repeatedly warned them not to accept men like these it seems some still do."
 buddhism_events.9.a:0 "We must remember to be gentle."

 buddhism_events.10.d:0 "The last seasons have not been very kind to the [Root.GetName] region and one of the duties of a [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] is to take care of the poor. A delegation of farmers has now approached [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] asking to be exempt from taxes and to receive a 3-year loan so that they are able to take care of their families while they work to get back on their feet."
 buddhism_events.10.a:0 "A reasonable request."

 buddhism_events.12.t:0 "Partial Recovery in [Root.GetName]"
 buddhism_events.12.d:0 "While the loan we granted the farmers in [Root.GetName] has helped them to slowly turn the area back to its former self they are still unable to pay the debt we once granted them."
 buddhism_events.12.a:0 "Write it off as a loss."
 buddhism_events.12.b:0 "Demand repayment."
 buddhism_events.13.t:0 "'Human Sacrifice'"
 buddhism_events.13.d:0 "[Root.GetName] is in dire need of better infrastructure. The local monasteries are doing what they can, as are the local aristocrats, but if the area is to prosper the state will have to step in. Plans to improve the situation require extra workers to join in the project from the countryside but all farmers are busy with the harvest. As ruler we can order them to lay down work to participate in construction projects for the common good but in return they will expect to be paid the customary 'Human Sacrifice' or the equivalent of the amount of rice that they could have grown during the same time."
 buddhism_events.13.a:0 "Pay the Human Sacrifice."
 buddhism_events.13.b:0 "Abandon the project."
 buddhism_events.13.c:0 "Demand that the farmers work without compensation."
 buddhism_events.14.t:0 "Bountiful Harvest"
 buddhism_events.14.d:0 "This harvest has been unusually bountiful and [Root.Monarch.GetName] could well make use of this unexpected wealth to fund planned religious works. An extra tax has been suggested to transfer the extra grain from the farmers to the state. However traditional Buddhist law dictates that he cannot take more than 10%, the 'Hay Sacrifice', of that which has been harvested and some of our ministers seem uneasy with breaking this rule."
 buddhism_events.14.a:0 "Levy the tax."
 buddhism_events.14.b:0 "Let us not steal the fruits of their labor."
 buddhism_events.15.t:0 "Dana"
 buddhism_events.15.d:0 "It is at times such as these, when our country is characterized by relative tranquility that we are reminded to look at those who are less fortunate. The recent crop yields have been neither failures nor a great success and as a result most have food and the state have ample grain supplies. There are however still some unfortunate who haven't got enough food to feed themselves."
 buddhism_events.15.a:0 "Let us distribute our grain to the poor!"
 buddhism_events.15.b:0 "Keep it in reserve."
 buddhism_events.16.t:0 "Vicious Words?"
 buddhism_events.16.d:0 "The local aristocracy in [Root.GetName] seems to have been growing quite powerful over the last few years. While we retain nominal control over the area much of the real power lies with the local landowners who have been known to grow their domains at the expense of monastery land. This practice, along with other excesses may well be used against them but in order to achieve the full effect we would probably need to embellish the truth a little. There are those who would be willing to do just that for us in exchange for nice positions in our administration afterwards."
 buddhism_events.16.a:0 "Let us find another way."
 buddhism_events.16.b:0 "The end justifies the means."
 buddhism_events.17.t:0 "Pariccaga"
 buddhism_events.17.d:0 "The willingness of [Root.Monarch.GetName] to risk life and limb in the protection of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] people is considered both unusual and worthy of respect. Leading monastic figures have voiced their support for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] and some even liken [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to an ideal ruler for this self sacrifice."
 buddhism_events.17.a:0 "Ok."
 buddhism_events.18.t:0 "Tapa"
 buddhism_events.18.d:0 "Recently [Root.Monarch.GetName] have come under attack by those who feel his rule has been one of extravagance and conspicuous consumption. Some of our ministers however insist that a certain amount of luxury is necessary for a ruler, especially when dealing with foreign monarchs and their emissaries."
 buddhism_events.18.a:0 "Let us do away with worldly things!"
 buddhism_events.18.b:0 "We cannot stoop to the level of peasants..."
 buddhism_events.19.t:0 "Political Rival Weakened"
 buddhism_events.19.d:0 "Even a great ruler has some detractors. A particularly successful and outspoken critic of [Root.Monarch.GetName] has lately gotten himself into a quite hard situation. His friends have left him and high debts make it very hard for him to support his family. While a resourceful person may yet recover from this situation we might also use this opportunity to get rid of this man once and for all."
 buddhism_events.19.a:0 "Make sure he never recovers!"
 buddhism_events.19.b:0 "A true [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] holds no grudges."
 buddhism_events.19.c:0 "This is a time for charity, let us help this man recover."
 buddhism_events.20.t:0 "Old Rival Recovers"
 buddhism_events.20.d:0 "Our willingness to help a rival in need has converted him from a detractor to a firm supporter. With his powerbase rebuilt he is now eager to serve [Root.Monarch.GetName] and apart from his political capital he offers his own services as a minister of our government."
 buddhism_events.20.a:0 "Great!"
 buddhism_events.21.t:0 "Old Rival Recovers"
 buddhism_events.21.d:0 "Our willingness to help a rival in need may have been a righteous act but now that he has recovered he is as critical as ever of our power. What transpired has perhaps weakened the basis of his position slightly but he is still intent to use all his power to sabotage the government of [Root.GetName]."
 buddhism_events.21.a:0 "No good deed goes unpunished..."
 buddhism_events.22.t:0 "Plight of [Root.GetName]"
 buddhism_events.22.d:0 "A representative of the farmers of [Root.GetName] arrived in [Root.Owner.Capital.GetCapitalName] today, imploring [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] to help expand and maintain the irrigation system of the province. The local population is growing and claiming new land at a speed that the current infrastructure does not support. The representative also asks that the state supply food to those who need it in the meantime.\nWhile this project would have few downsides besides the cost there are currently no plans to improve this particular region and doing so in reasonable time would likely be quite expensive."
 buddhism_events.22.a:0 "This [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] is always ready to listen to the people."
 buddhism_events.22.b:0 "You will have to wait for your turn."
 buddhism_events.23.t:0 "Inheritance"
 buddhism_events.23.d:0 "A conflict has arisen in one of the more influential monasteries of [Root.GetName] after the death of a monk. The monk in question came from a very influential lay family and during his time in robes had managed to acquire a rich set of valuable manuscripts and an assortment of Buddha images and other things. While monks cannot own property as such the law still allows for a dedicated disciple to inherit these things and be considered as a son to the monk. In this case a young disciple has taken care of the monk as he lay at his end. There are however others interested, the monastery itself has argued that they should get the inheritance and would likely be very thankful for support in this matter. The lay family of the monk have also approached [Root.Monarch.GetName] hoping to inherit not only the manuscripts and images but also some of the land they have donated to the monastery while their family member was part of it."
 buddhism_events.23.a:0 "Rule in favor of the disciple."
 buddhism_events.23.b:0 "Rule in favor of the Monastery."
 buddhism_events.23.c:0 "Support the lay family of the monk."
 buddhism_events.24.t:0 "Powerful Monastery in [Root.GetName]"
 buddhism_events.24.d:0 "The monastaries of [Root.GetName] harbor some of the oldest and finest lineages in [Root.Owner.Country.GetName] and have therefore always been influential. They have however over the years come to grow more and more powerful and have also come to cultivate a disturbingly close relationship to other powers in the region. It is hard by now to find any person of influence in one of the monastaries that do not come from one of the richer noble families in the region. Monastic discipline is important but attacking a powerful Monastery as entrenched as this is not done lightly, a tempting option is to simply ally with the monks and let them lend their power to ours."
 buddhism_events.24.a:0 "A cleansing is required!"
 buddhism_events.24.b:0 "Seek the blessing of the monks."
 buddhism_events.24.c:0 "Ignore the situation."
 buddhism_events.25.t:0 "Banditry in [Root.GetName]"
 buddhism_events.25.d:0 "Bandits have been harassing the province of [Root.GetName] for quite a while now, roads are unsafe and traders have been avoiding the area and taking alternate routes to get past. As local authority isn't as strong in this area as in some other parts of our Empire the brigands have been able to continue unchecked for now. This has become a matter of some concern even outside of the area as the leader of the band has been gaining a reputation as a leader of resistance against central power in general.\nLocal authorities have reached out to the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] for help to deal with the problem before it spreads."
 buddhism_events.25.a:0 "We need to deal with these thieves."
 buddhism_events.25.b:0 "Let the local authorities handle it."
 buddhism_events.25.a.tt:0 "State help will help conclude this matter without diverting local funds. The process can be speeded up by decreasing local autonomy."
 buddhism_events.25.b.tt:0 "Left to their own devises authorities will have to divert part of the local income to catch the bandits. The process can be speeded up by decreasing local autonomy."
 buddhism_events.26.t:0 "Bandit leader caught in [Root.GetName]"
 buddhism_events.26.d:0 "The campaign in [Root.GetName] to catch the leader of the bandits in the area has finally proved successful. During the hunt for him his popularity has only increased however and it is clear this is a very dangerous man to be alive. The commander of the troops that caught the man recommends that we kill him now and not risk that he may one day incite those who idealize him to revolt against us. One of our ministers however wishes to remind [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] that to save a life is better than building a seven level pagoda."
 buddhism_events.26.a:0 "Kill them all."
 buddhism_events.26.a.tt:0 "Risk martyring the bandits."
 buddhism_events.26.b:0 "Banish him and imprison his followers."
 buddhism_events.26.b.tt:0 "The Bandit leader may return one day."
 buddhism_events.27.t:0 "Bandit Leader Returns"
 buddhism_events.27.d:0 "The man we once banished for banditry in one of our provinces seems to have returned to our country, ready to once again make life hard for our local subjects. There is still a lingering popularity in some parts of the country and it is feared he may make good use of this to avoid the authorities once more.\nBy all accounts however he is an older and weaker man now and while the situation is still problematic it seems clear he cannot go on for long this time."
 buddhism_events.27.a:0 "Ok."
 buddhism_events.28.t:0 "The Myth Lives on"
 buddhism_events.28.d:0 "The reputation of the bandit leader we had executed a few years ago has refused to die with him. While his band of brigands can no longer terrorize traders and endanger the integrity of our roads the myth of the bandit leader has grown out of all proportion. Eventually his fate will surely be one of many old stories told to young kids with little meaning, right now however it is a story told to ridicule [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] rule."
 buddhism_events.28.a:0 "Ok."
 buddhism_events.29.t:0 "Foreign Emissary Insults [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 buddhism_events.29.d:0 "The emissary of one of our neighboring countries has given grave affront to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] by refusing to participate in a ceremony he was invited to attend. [Root.Monarch.GetName] is furious and while there can be some doubt as to if the slight was deliberate or not the public clearly sees it as such.\nIf we do not publicly condemn the ambassador we risk losing face, the council of ministers however urge caution."
 buddhism_events.29.a:0 "Publicly deride the ambassador."
 buddhism_events.29.b:0 "A ruler must never lose [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] temper."

 buddhism_events.31.d:0 "Pali law is generally practiced in one form or another in many Buddhist countries and especially among the Theravada ones. While these laws are not collected and written down by the states themselves they do vary from country to country and at times a collection will have to be updated or renewed. A wise monk has undertaken such a collection recently in [Root.GetName] and has produced an updated version of one of the most commonly used law collections in our country.\nAs the collection itself builds upon actual cases it can however be seen as quite an up to date commentary on the rulings of [Root.Monarch.GetName]."

 buddhism_events.32.d:0 "Lawyers placing bets on the outcome of a legal dispute is nothing uncommon in our lands and neither is a certain degree of friendly rivalry among the professionals in a courtroom. Once such rivalry turns into actual anger and passion then the integrity of our laws is at stake.\nIt appears two lawyers, each representing powerful patrons, one a rich monastery and the other an aristocrat family of some influence, have turned a recent legal conflict about a sizable estate into a heated row. This is very unfortunate and it now falls upon [Root.Monarch.GetName] to attempt to salvage the face of both sides in a fair way without compromising the integrity of our courts."

 buddhism_events.33.d:0 "Many ages ago Mongol rulers adopted the Buddhist religion and sought to spread it among their people. Over the years however many have returned to the old ways of the Shamans. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has always been fascinated by the legacy of the likes of Kublai Khan and the empires they once created in the name of that religion. As word reach us of a dynamic and growing Tibetan monastic order it was therefore clear to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] that this needed to be investigated.\nThe emissary of the Lama now stands before us and has explained that the Lama indeed expects that [Root.Monarch.GetName] is a reincarnation of Kublai Khan. He is also prepared to support our rule if we allow him to spread his sect in all the lands we control."

If he is to come to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] however we must be able to do far more than just guarantee his safety. For the Lama to tie his destiny with ours we must swear that he and his future incarnations will be given the proper respect and influence in our realm and that we will create a great Monastery for him and his disciples. If we cannot make these guarantees we will have to content ourselves with receiving a delegation of monks eager to found a new Monastery in our lands."

It is in many ways a model society for a Theravada state and its thriving Monastic communities are the envy of the Buddhist world.\nWhile our own state also follows the Theravada way our laws and traditions are a patchwork of local traditions, ideas from competing Buddhist schools and we lack the strong Monastic infrastructure of the island. Our ministers suggest that in order to remedy this we should send an embassy to Sri Lanka and ask that they send us monks to carry their Theravada traditions to our country."

 buddhism_events.41.d:0 "Thriving Monastic communities, holy sacred relics as well as a long tradition of how to handle the coexistence of monastic and regal power make us the envy of many Theravada rulers. It is therefore no suprise that the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of [From.GetName] should aspire to imitate our greatness. The [From.GetAdjective] embassy that arrived today asks that we allow a number of their monks to travel to our country and receive ordination here in order to bring our traditions to [From.GetName]."

 confucian_events.1.d:0 "Our efforts to integrate our [pagan_province.Religion.GetName] subjects has now finally started to pay off. Our pagan subjects have begun to accept the ideals of Confucianism and our local officials have also integrated elements of the local religion and culture in our wider confucian corpus of ideals. As local bureaucrats enter our administration the pagan customs have to some extent began to filter upwards. Even among prominent officials in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] a small altar can sometimes be found to a [pagan_province.Religion.GetName] pantheon.\nPaganism has become one of the many religions of our Confucian [Root.GovernmentName]."

Where there was once distrust in the classics and our system for education and governance there is now widespread understanding. In turn our Christian subjects have been taken in and made part of our [Root.GovernmentName], and some of their customs have now become ours. In [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] even some of the most well educated Confucian scholars can be seen partaking in Christian customs and visiting Christian churches."

Over time however it has grown into a more and more integrated part of our society. Muslim ideals have been integrated and harmonized with our traditions, rites and methods and we have taken the best of what the religion has had to offer to mould to our own uses. Islamic scholars, doctors, merchants, farmers and peasants can be found even in the districts around [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName].

 confucian_events.4.d:0 "The faith of the Dharmic peoples has been intertwined with our own for millennia yet our beliefs have diverged for almost as long. For a long time it was believed that where we lauded reason and classical learning they strived for diversity and an ancient spiritual power. Over the last years however we have strived to integrate the Dharmic society with ours and make their beliefs fit in with our equally strong traditions of philosophy and learning. As we look ahead a common future beckons where the diversity of the Dharmic pantheon can be cherished together with the Confucian classics.

In a newfound fascination for their ancient Abrahamic religion we have done what we can to integrate them in our rites, traditions and education.

 confucian_events.6.d:0 "The bearers of a tradition that is said to be even older than our own the Zoroastrians are a people that have seen their political influence come and then fade. It was clear that we had much to learn from these teachings, as they could learn much from our superior tradition of reason, justice and fairness. When communities such as the one in [zoroastrian_province.GetName] became part of our [Root.GovernmentName] it allowed our traditions to begin a new phase of harmonization.

 confucian_events.7.d:0 "The Japanese have over time come to incorporate both the traditions of Confucius and Buddha into their own old Shinto faith, taking what they feel was the most true and best serving parts of the foreign teachings and making it their own. In many ways this has in turn made their religion easier to incorporate and harmonize with the ideology of [Root.GetName]. As time goes by the Shinto identity becomes less and less of an issue and Shinto followers can be found high and low in [Root.GetAdjective] society, forming a new group within our complex government apparatus that an outsider would have a very hard time distinguishing from our own."

Where they once used the traditions of the Vajrayana way to judge the world they are now incorporating the same classics that we have.

 confucian_events.11.d:0 "The followers of the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] faith have increasingly come to integrate Confucian concepts and our rites in their daily life. A recent trend is to identify the concept of Shangdi with their own supreme deities. This interpretation is somewhat unorthodox to the scholar experts of our [Root.GovernmentName], but it has allowed the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] faithful to integrate a number of confucian concepts, rites, constants and classical teaching in their theology.\nThere is some debate in the palace halls of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] if this is the right and proper way on the path for the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] adherents to elevate themselves from barbarians to Hua."

If they are to ever elevate themselves from the Barbarian Yi of this world we must perhaps ensure that the classics and the proper rites are available for them to digest in their own language.\nThere are some scholars that have already began to create such works.

As their traditions and ceremonies regarding rulership already contains a concept of a high worldly power such as our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] this is something we could make good use of. Local officials in [harmonization_province.GetName] have already been doing so but it has been suggested that we make use of [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] ceremonies even at higher levels.

 confucian_events.17.d:1 "Some barbarians are more susceptible to reason and intellect than others. The [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName]s of [harmonization_province.GetName] have already taken to many of our traditions, from the more important to even minor things. Visiting foreigners have a hard time telling the region apart from [Root.GetName] proper as apart from some minor excentricities the [Root.Capital.Culture.GetName] language, names and customs seem as [Root.GetAdjective] as any part of the [Root.GetName] [Root.GovernmentName]."

 confucian_events.18.t:0 "Xiaoren?"
 confucian_events.18.d:0 "The rule of our great [Root.GovernmentName] is the foremost responsibility and privilege of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. The [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] have in the past prided themselves on leading through example, observing strict etiquette, personal austerity and carefully weeding out those that do not conform to this ideal.\nIt is therefore with a heavy heart that [Root.Monarch.GetName] has observed the development of [Root.Heir.GetName]. Far from an ideal [Root.Heir.GetWomanMan] our imperial heir is often described by [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] teachers as a petty person, focused on immediate gain and emotional pleasures. There are however factions at court that would be most dismayed if we abandoned [Root.Heir.GetName], a new heir would not have their support."

 confucian_events.19.t:1 "Popular Novel"
 confucian_events.19.d:1 "A vernacular novel about a well known story from the [Root.GetOldEra] era is rapidly gaining popularity among our subjects. This in itself is not a problem but it has come to our attention that this novelization is in fact breaking central tenets of Confucian ideology as it could be seen as an argument for disobeying central authority and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].\nOur administrators now argue that the book must be banned, though some fear this will only make it more alluring to those that wish to read it."
 confucian_events.19.a:1 "It must be banned immediately."

 confucian_events.20.t:1 "Civil Service"
 confucian_events.20.d:1 "Education, self improvement and adherence to the classics is the backbone of Confucian government and if our [Root.GovernmentName] is to aspire to greatness we must at all times devote money, attention and energy to ensuring that our officials are as well educated and well informed as they can possibly be.

[Root.Monarch.GetName] has [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] shown great interest in the foreign religion but still practices many of the rituals of our ancestors. Perhaps it is because [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] takes such interest in them that the Muslim community itself has come to scrutinize the life and actions of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. The Muslim community leaders question whether [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] decisions are really made with the best interests of them and their god in mind."
 tengri_events.12.a:0 "Vow to lead a more devout life."
 tengri_events.12.b:0 "Our [Root.Religion.GetName] traditions must come first."
 tengri_events.12.b.tt:0 "Every province following our §YSyncretic§! Faith will suffer §R5§! unrest for §Y10§! years."
 tengri_events.13.t:0 "Incident at Court"
 tengri_events.13.d:0 "In an unfortunate gaffe our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has managed to upset the Muslim community of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] by including their leaders in a [Root.Religion.GetName] ceremony. While this act was intended entirely as an honor it has resulted in some very sore feelings among the Muslims in our capital and elsewhere."
 tengri_events.13.a:0 "Ok."
 tengri_events.14.t:0 "Warriors of the Faith"
 tengri_events.14.d:0 "Our country is in some ways at the frontier of the Islamic world and as such mostly attracts the attention of traveling Sufis or merchants. It seems however that a fervent preacher has managed to convince a large group of warriors to submit to this foreign god and these men are now taking part in our current wars against their religious enemies with a newfound fervor."
 tengri_events.14.a:0 "Great!"
 tengri_events.15.t:0 "Conflict between Cities and Nomads"
 tengri_events.15.d:0 "With the increasing influence of Islam, especially in our growing cities, the older legal codes such as the Yassa have increasingly come to be abandoned in favor of the Sharia that our Muslim urban dwellers prefer.\nThis development has recently resulted in a heated legal battle in [Root.GetName] where an important warrior from a local clan is insisting on his rights according to tradition while the urban establishment is insisting on following the Sharia. Supporting one side over the other will undoubtedly have repercussions for the development of the entire area."
 tengri_events.15.a:0 "Appoint a Muslim judge to the case."
 tengri_events.15.b:0 "Appoint someone to judge according to our traditions."
 tengri_events.16.t:0 "Popular Sufi Teacher"
 tengri_events.16.d:0 "A teacher of a lineage of famous Sufis has recently gained increasing popularity in our lands. His teachings have not only won the ears of our Muslim communities but also have deeply impressed the more traditional warrior elites. Many that listen to his words will still not forsake the Tengri Shamans but the teacher's charismatic personality ensures that even so they will value every word of this 'Khoja'. A local noble that managed to come into conflict with the Khoja lost so badly he had to abandon his lands.\nSo far the Khoja have been quietly supporting our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], perhaps he could be persuaded to support the throne a bit more openly if we grant him land and an official title at our court?"
 tengri_events.16.a:0 "Let him serve the throne!"
 tengri_events.16.a.tt:0 "Every future ruler will be offered this modifier but the Khoja or his descendants may well try to take power themselves eventually."
 tengri_events.16.b:0 "No, he is too dangerous."
 tengri_events.16.b.tt:0 "The Khoja and his descendants will not bother us again."
 tengri_events.17.t:0 "The Khojas"
 tengri_events.17.d:0 "The power of the Khoja lineage over our subjects is almost too great. They are constantly meddling in legal cases, religious policy and the day-to-day business of our country. The Khoja is however still one of the most valiant supporters of the throne. With the crowning of [Root.Monarch.GetName] we will be expected to affirm the ties to the Khoja and perhaps extend his privileges even further."
 tengri_events.17.a:0 "He remains our strongest supporter."
 tengri_events.17.a.tt:0 "This will strengthen the Khoja and increase the likeliness of him or his successors attempting to take power in the future."
 tengri_events.17.b:0 "Attempt to limit the influence of the Khojas."
 tengri_events.17.b.tt:0 "This will weaken the influence of the Khojas and their chances to take power in the future."
 tengri_events.18.t:0 "The Khoja takes power"
 tengri_events.18.d:0 "Not content to continue to serve as the power behind the throne the current head of the Khoja lineage has today declared himself to be more fit to rule than any [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. His followers are massing on the outskirts of our capital as well as in the countryside attempting to create a state built directly upon the teachings of their charismatic Sufi teacher."
 tengri_events.18.a:0 "There is but one God!"
 tengri_events.18.b:0 "Protect our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]!"
 tengri_events.19.t:0 "Shiite Diaspora"
 tengri_events.19.d:0 "While there is ample doubt about the sincerity of our conviction word of our conversion has spread among the Shiite communities around the world. Small groups of Shiites have begun to arrive in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] seeking to help build and protect a state for those that honor the Imams.\nTheir services might come in quite handy but our Shamans are apprehensive about allowing what they see as foreign zealots to settle among our people."
 tengri_events.19.a:0 "Settle them near our capital."
 tengri_events.19.b:0 "Settle them in the countryside."
 tengri_events.19.c:0 "Turn them away."
 tengri_events.20.t:0 "Influx of Monks"
 tengri_events.20.d:0 "A large delegation of Vajrayana Monks have arrived in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] today. Having learned of the interest we are taking in their faith they are eager to explain it not only to our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] but to our many subjects."
 tengri_events.20.a:0 "Allow them to travel freely."
 tengri_events.20.a.tt:0 "Increases the chances of conversion to Vajrayana in provinces with the §YInflux of Monks§! modifier."
 tengri_events.20.b:0 "Confine them to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]."
 tengri_events.20.b.tt:0 "Increases the chances of conversions to Vajrayana in all our provinces."
 tengri_events.20.c:0 "Turn them away."
 tengri_events.21.t:0 "Religious texts translated into [Root.Culture.GetName]"
 tengri_events.21.d:0 "In their desire to spread their faith and incorporate the [Root.GetName] realm into the wider Buddhist world some monks have taken it upon themselves to translate many Buddhist historical, philosophical and religious works for the benefit of our people. These manuscripts have opened the eyes of many to a new spiritual world as well as given us a better understanding of the surrounding world in general. Among the nobility collecting these manuscripts has become fashionable, though some would say not always for spiritual reasons."
 tengri_events.21.a:0 "Welcome the dissemination of these books."
 tengri_events.21.b:0 "We must honor our ancient traditions instead."
 tengri_events.22.t:0 "Shaman Defeated in [Root.GetName]"
 tengri_events.22.d:0 "Strange tales are reaching us from the provinces of a traveling Buddhist Monk using his wisdom to overcome various problems and spreading his faith among the many people benefiting from his help. Not everyone is happy with these advances among the common people however as they often involve defeating the local Shamans.\nIn [Root.GetName] this monk reportedly defeated a local Shaman and cured a local princess from a severe malady, leaving the traditional rituals appearing poor and insufficient. As a result the local lord has banned traditional rituals in his lands and is instead promoting [Root.SecondaryReligion.GetName]."
 tengri_events.22.a:0 "Great."
 tengri_events.22.b:0 "Depose the noble."
 tengri_events.23.t:0 "Burning of Idols in [Root.GetName]"
 tengri_events.23.d:0 "For some time Vajrayana monks have been gaining followers in the province of [Root.GetName] and while their influence is still quite limited they have apparently taken it upon themselves to go one step further in their missionary activity. Reports are reaching [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] of the destruction and incineration of our ancestral idols. The general reception of this policy has not turned out as the monks would have hoped however as the locals are now defending themselves from both the monks and the central authority that favors them."
 tengri_events.23.a:0 "Ok."
 tengri_events.24.t:0 "Religious Pilgrimages"
 tengri_events.24.d:0 "It has become customary among our nobles to travel to the holy places of Vajrayana Buddhism in Tibet and India to study and learn of the Buddhist faith. As they return bringing new customs and perspectives to our country our society is slowly changing. This is not always a process without problems but recently we have been seeing some very positive trends in our government as a result of this exchange."
 tengri_events.24.a:0 "Great!"
 tengri_events.25.t:0 "Land Theft"
 tengri_events.25.d:0 "With the increasing influence of the [Root.SecondaryReligion.GetName] faith in our country a number of new monasteries have been founded in our country. Their purpose is both to harbor the [Root.SecondaryReligion.GetName] monks that have come to our lands and the slowly growing number of native [Root.GetAdjective] monks.\nTraditional landholders don't seem to be very impressed by the pretensions of these newcomers however and have been helping themselves to the lands reserved for the monks. The monks claim that the land would be made more productive under their control while the land holders feel they are demanding the right to what is already theirs."
 tengri_events.25.a:0 "We must support these orders!"
 tengri_events.25.b:0 "We must protect the traditional rights of our people."
 tengri_events.26.t:0 "Pali Legal Traditions"
 tengri_events.26.d:0 "With Theravada Buddhism comes an ancient legal tradition based on old Pali scriptures as well as the collected rulings of many judges and monarchs before up to this day. Some Theravada monks have found our lack of collected written rulings very disturbing and have sought our blessings to create a collection of up-to-date rulings that, together with the Pali Canon, could serve as a basis for future rulings in our country."
 tengri_events.26.a:0 "Allow the scholars to continue."
 tengri_events.26.b:0 "The Yassa is enough for us."
 tengri_events.27.t:0 "Pure Land Buddhism"
 tengri_events.27.d:0 "By adopting the Mahayana faith we have opened our borders to a wide range of traditions and teachings but none seem to have attracted as many followers as the promises of the 'Pure Land' movement has. Throughout [Root.GetName] subjects immersed in meditation and recitation have become an increasingly common sight."
 tengri_events.27.a:0 "Amitabhaya."
 tengri_events.30.t:0 "Spread of Confucian Ideals"
 tengri_events.30.d:0 "Impressed by the refined and well-argued tenets of Confucianism many of our nobles have begun to strive to improve themselves through rigorous study and hard work. As a result we are not only becoming better at understanding the wider Confucian world but the administration of our land and resources has notably improved and above all become more consistent."
 tengri_events.30.a:0 "Recruit these men as administrators."
 tengri_events.30.b:0 "We can use this to purge corruption."
 tengri_events.30.c:0 "Let us encourage them to develop the land itself."
 tengri_events.31.t:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and the Beiles"
 tengri_events.31.d:0 "As the learned ideals of Confucian philosophy gain more and more ground among the [Root.GetAdjective] nobility [Root.Monarch.GetName] has been beset by fears that our old ways are being forgotten. Many high ranking [Root.GetAdjective] dignitaries have taken to using foreign titles and names rather than the [Root.Culture.GetName] titles of our ancestors. Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] worries that in a generation none will remember the old ways of the bow and horse and our nation will be one of weak scribes and poets."
 tengri_events.31.a:0 "No nation that has abandoned its own language can prosper!"
 tengri_events.31.b:0 "We have no reason to fear the Confucian Way."
 tengri_events.32.t:0 "Confucian Elites Alienated"
 tengri_events.32.d:0 "Participation in many traditional rituals is reserved for our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and those closest to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. While this means the Confucian elite of our country cannot take part this has not often been a problem as they view such 'superstitious' rituals and sacrifices with at best mild displeasure. This insistence to keep our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and his closest from the old [Root.Religion.GetName] elites separate from our other subjects has however led to an unnecessarily sharp divide between the two groups. This, rather than the rituals themselves, seems to be a constant source of irritation and misunderstandings, even at the very top of our society."
 tengri_events.32.a:0 "Praise the heavens!"
 tengri_events.32.b:0 "Let us device common rituals instead."
 tengri_events.33.t:0 "[Root.Heir.GetName]"
 tengri_events.33.d:0 "Those around [Root.Heir.GetName] agree that the child is showing promise beyond what was initially expected. [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] is learning quickly and [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] skills are improving by the day.\nTraditionally the heirs of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] should spend their young years learning how to ride and shoot as the [Root.Culture.GetName] warriors of our past. This might not be the best way to take care of the growing abilities of [Root.Heir.GetName] however. Given the opportunity Confucian teachers promise to teach our heir how to better [Root.Heir.GetHerselfHimself] and more importantly how to rule and make the most of our land and its subjects."
 tengri_events.33.a:0 "Let us hire Confucian teachers."
 tengri_events.33.b:0 "A traditional education is the only way."
 tengri_events.33.c:0 "We have no extra resources to spare for [Root.Heir.GetHerHim]."
 tengri_events.35.t:0 "Spread of the Tea Ceremony"
 tengri_events.35.d:0 "The elaborate Tea Ceremonies that are common in many Shinto lands have spread far further than the Shinto religion itself and are becoming commonplace in most [Root.GetAdjective] cities as well as among the members of our court."
 tengri_events.34.t:0 "Examination of Administrators"
 tengri_events.34.d:0 "The Chinese have long felt that a good way to ensure efficient administration according to Confucian ideals is to hold general examinations for all administrators. This works well for a country with generations of experience to draw upon, something we do not have.\nThe current lack of both administrators and teachers might be remedied by attracting some of those that have failed the examinations in neighboring countries but we would be paying a high price for an uncertain commodity."
 tengri_events.34.a:0 "It is a risk we must take."
 tengri_events.34.b:0 "Let us seek talent among our own instead."
 tengri_events.35.a:0 "Our courtly culture will never be the same."
 tengri_events.35.b:0 "Encourage the spread of the Way of Tea."
 tengri_events.36.t:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] Loses Face"
 tengri_events.36.d:0 "The Shinto view of failure is somewhat different from that of our Tengri traditions. As Shinto values become an increasingly important part of our society the expectations on our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] change.\nSome actions of [Root.Monarch.GetName] have come to be interpreted as lacking in both honor and ability by those who follow the syncretic mix of Shinto and Tengri customs that has come to take shape in our lands."
 tengri_events.36.a:0 "This is unfortunate."
 tengri_events.36.b:0 "The Shamans say I cannot be faulted."
 tengri_events.37.t:0 "Japanese Swordsmithing"
 tengri_events.37.d:0 "Opening up our realm to Shinto customs and culture have also resulted in an increasing migration of Shinto practitioners into our lands, among them a number of Japanese weaponsmiths. The Swords they produce have become increasingly popular with the richer parts of our society and Japanese smiths are becoming common in most of our cities. Many of our elite warriors have begun to train with these weapons.\nSome worry that this will mean the abandonment of the Martial traditions of our ancestors though even those that cling to the old ways have benefited from a greater understanding of foreign fighting techniques."
 tengri_events.37.a:0 "Encourage our elites to use these swords."
 tengri_events.37.b:0 "Bow and arrow is for the true Tengri warrior."
 tengri_events.38.t:0 "Growth of Monasteries"
 tengri_events.38.d:0 "Used to acting far away from the Patriarch of their church the Coptic Monastic Orders have quickly made themselves at home in our lands. They are now growing in numbers and influence, especially in the frontier regions under our control. Under ideal circumstances the orders stand ready to move into a newly conquered region, establishing new monasteries, quickly stabilizing and converting the region to their faith. Our Shamans are alarmed at this practice as they feel they should be the ones to welcome our new subjects rather than these foreign Monks."
 tengri_events.38.a:0 "Excellent!"
 tengri_events.38.b:0 "We must promote our Tengri Shamans!"
 tengri_events.39.t:0 "Papal Embassy"
 tengri_events.39.d:0 "An official Papal embassy has arrived in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] seeking audience with [Root.Monarch.GetName]. The task of the envoys is to judge the sincerity of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], to once again hear him accept the pope as the head of the church and to include [Root.Monarch.GetName] into the wider Catholic community.\nIn order to achieve this the envoys have brought with them a number of books, maps and learned men. Surely these men are also spies, eager to learn our secrets. It is also certain that our Shamans will disagree with any policy of bowing to a foreign head of religion and refusing them an audience would please them. But perhaps the knowledge these Catholics bring can make up for missing that opportunity."
 tengri_events.39.a:0 "Send these spies back home!"
 tengri_events.39.b:0 "We are loyal followers of the Roman Church."
 tengri_events.40.t:0 "Christian Missionaries"
 tengri_events.40.d:0 "A group of Christian missionaries from abroad has arrived in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] and are eager to spread the word of God among the heathens. Not wanting to come into conflict with our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] however they come seeking our blessing. The leader of the group has approached the throne asking to be given the right to spread the Christian faith in a region under our control unhindered."
 tengri_events.40.a:0 "Let them go wherever they please."
 tengri_events.40.b:0 "Send them back where they came from."
 tengri_events.40.a.tt:0 "This province may come to change Religion in the future."
 tengri_events.40.c:0 "Prohibit them from converting Tengriists."
 tengri_events.41.t:0 "Spread of Christianity"
 tengri_events.41.d:0 "The missionaries in [Root.GetName] have made good progress towards converting the local population there. Shamans have become an increasingly rare sight and a number of churches dot the landscape."
 tengri_events.41.a:0 "Praise the Lord."
 tengri_events.42.t:0 "Conflicts between Shamans and Missionaries"
 tengri_events.42.d:0 "The presence of a mission in [Root.GetName] has led to a number of conflicts between the [Root.Religion.GetName] Shamans and the local Priests. Shamans have proclaimed curses over the priests and sometimes on entire congregations."
 tengri_events.42.a:0 "It is time for the missionaries to leave."
 tengri_events.42.b:0 "We must not interfere."
 tengri_events.43.t:0 "Christian Ruler Alarmed"
 tengri_events.43.d:0 "The adoption of Christianity beside the traditional [Root.Religion.GetName] faith of our ancestors has given rise to a number of less than orthodox customs. Syncretic rituals that reference both the god of Christianity and the gods of the sky have become commonplace and some have even been adopted at the court of [Root.Monarch.GetName].\nWhile this seems to please most of our Christian subjects the delicate sensibilities of a Christian subject ruler visiting [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] have been deeply upset by his forced participation in such rituals."
 tengri_events.43.a:0 "But they're both lords of heaven?"
 tengri_events.43.b:0 "Try to make amends."
 tengri_events.44.t:0 "Miracle"
 tengri_events.44.d:0 "Word has reached us of a remarkable wanderer. Drawing his power from his strong devotion to the Christian god he has managed to heal the weak and cure the sick. An increasing number of converts have begun to create congregations in his trail. Many still incorporate parts of their old Tengri customs in their daily life but this holy man has been more successful in attracting followers than many of the more traditional missionaries that now frequent our countryside."
 tengri_events.44.a:0 "Let him roam freely."
 tengri_events.44.b:0 "Invite him to Court."
 tengri_events.45.t:0 "Life at Court"
 tengri_events.45.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] has always taken a great interest in both our adopted religion and those that practice it. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] has however not always led a life that many of our Christian subjects would approve of. Between the influence of Shamans at court and the habits of [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] there are many that feel we are risking divine punishment.\nPerhaps we should consider instituting some more clearly Christian rules for our court and ruler? Restricting the influence of Shamans, the number of allowed wives and generally the number of officially sanctioned rituals would go a long way towards placating the Christian communities."
 tengri_events.45.a:0 "A Christian court it is!"
 tengri_events.45.b:0 "Theses religions must coexist, side by side."
 tengri_events.45.b.tt:0 "Every province following our §YSyncretic§! faith will get §R6§! unrest for §Y10§! years."
 tengri_events.46.t:0 "Brahmans and Shamans"
 tengri_events.46.d:0 "A battle of the minds and spirits of our people has ensued between Brahmin priests and Shamans, who consider themselves guides and protectors of our people. Lately heated discussions frequently end with Shamans cursing the Brahmins while the Brahmins turn to us, insisting that their hereditary status be respected."
 tengri_events.46.a:0 "Support the Brahmin Administrators."
 tengri_events.46.b:0 "Support our Shamans."
 tengri_events.46.c:0 "Avoid picking sides."
 tengri_events.47.t:0 "Syncretism"
 tengri_events.47.d:0 "The coexistence of Hinduism and the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith has been easier in many ways than we initially feared. There are already many examples of Tengri deities being incorporated among the many gods of the Hindus and of Hindu gods and customs being incorporated into the lives of the Tengri worshippers. In fact to a certain extent it seems that the same has started happening to many other religions in the far corners of our empire, with many lesser and higher gods being incorporated into the joint Hindu-Tengri Pantheon."
 tengri_events.47.a:0 "Great!"
 tengri_events.48.t:0 "Spread of the Caste System"
 tengri_events.48.d:0 "With the elevation of the Hindu faith a great number of Hindus have come to settle in many of our cities and with them the concept of caste is spreading into our lands. Interestingly it seems at least some of those that regularly do business with the Hindus as well as some of our Shamans have taken to this way to organize society.\nThe immediate effects seem hard to judge but for now everything seems to progress a bit more smoothly in [Root.GetName]."
 tengri_events.48.a:0 "Ok."
 tengri_events.49.t:0 "A Jewish Homeland?"
 tengri_events.49.d:0 "Word of our adoption of the Jewish religion has started to spread far and wide among the Jews of the Diaspora. A slow but increasingly steady trickle of immigrants have begun to appear at our borders, hoping to live and serve in a state where they are not confined to Ghettos or restricted by laws and prejudice."
 tengri_events.49.a:0 "Let them serve as administrators!"
 tengri_events.49.b:0 "Let them serve as soldiers!"
 tengri_events.50.t:0 "Growing Zoroastrian Merchant Community"
 tengri_events.50.d:0 "While the Fire temples of [Root.GetName] probably seem a bit unorthodox to them our society is still attracting a number of Zoroastrians in the diaspora. Ever since they left Persia behind almost a millennium ago they have grown used to being the minority and seem content to mix with our society at large. Some however have come asking for an area of their own where they can live and worship in their traditional ways."
 tengri_events.50.a:0 "'Like sugar in milk.'"
 tengri_events.50.b:0 "Best to keep them all in one place."
 tengri_events.51.t:0 "Growing Pantheon"
 tengri_events.51.d:0 "Fusing our Shamanic traditions with the wide range of animist beliefs we have come across have resulted in an ever-growing Pantheon. There is not a malady, disaster or fate that hasn't got at least one deity to counteract it. This wide acceptance of differing spiritual traditions has led to an increasingly efficient handling of the religious conflicts between the subjects under our control, no matter what they believe."
 tengri_events.51.a:0 "Great."
 tengri_events.52.t:0 "Support of the Shamans"
 tengri_events.52.d:0 "Court Shamans have always been an important institution in our state. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] nobles participate in a wide range of ceremonies to ensure the gods looking favorable on our endeavors, be it going to war or sealing a strategic marriage. With the greatly increased numbers of Shamanic traditions we now patronize we can be sure of their support, a point not lost on our subjects."
 tengri_events.52.a:0 "The Gods favor our wars."
 tengri_events.52.b:0 "The Gods will bless our people."
 tengri_events.53.t:0 "Flower Wars"
 tengri_events.53.d:0 "Inspired by Nahuatl forerunners our warriors have begun to raid foreign lands already subjugated by our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to take prisoners to be offered at the Sacrificial Stone to the heavens. This is slightly problematic as these are people who have agreed to obey us in exchange for protection but the experience these warriors get in close combat could be useful to us."
 tengri_events.53.a:0 "Extradite the offending warriors."
 tengri_events.53.b:0 "The gods crave their blood!"
 tengri_events.54.t:0 "Sumptuary Restrictions?"
 tengri_events.54.d:0 "Taking offense to the luxurious clothes of a merchant in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] a number of warriors have taken it upon themselves to storm his lavish home and rob him of his belongings. They claim such finery must be reserved for those that have distinguished themselves in battle and that they have rectified an offense to the gods. The merchant on the other hand is furious and demand retribution and for his property to be returned."
 tengri_events.54.a:0 "Side with the merchant."
 tengri_events.54.b:0 "Side with the warriors."
 tengri_events.55.t:0 "Confiscation of Idols"
 tengri_events.55.d:0 "The people of [Root.GetName] have been organizing their resistance against our rule through the local holy places and many of their leaders are to be found in the local clergy. Assimilation will surely quieten them in the long run but for now our Inti priests suggest that we confiscate their [Root.Religion.GetName] idols, by protecting them in our capital we can ensure that the people of [Root.GetName] remember where the real power lies."
 tengri_events.55.a:0 "An excellent idea."
 tengri_events.55.b:0 "Barbaric."
 tengri_events.56.t:0 "Ritual Ball Game"
 tengri_events.56.d:0 "Our Mayan priests are eager to promote the ritual ball games of their religion, a custom to which many of our warriors have been quite receptive. Many now flock to the courts to see their favorite teams compete though perhaps the associated betting is as much of an attraction as their religious conviction."

 tengri_events.57.t:1 "New Bible Translation"
 tengri_events.57.d:1 "Eager for all our subjects to be able to read and interpret the word of God themselves the Protestant priests of our country are seeking our support for creating a new Bible translation. They claim the new translation will bring our people together as never before and introduce them to the one god they worship."
 tengri_events.57.a:1 "Great!"
 tengri_events.58.t:1 "Predestination"
 tengri_events.58.d:1 "The idea that 'All events whatsoever are governed by the secret counsel of God' is held dearly among the members of the Reformed church in our country. So much so that it has come to spread beyond to those that wouldn't be considered Christians by any definition. Whether it is due to this or not lately many of our subjects seem unusually eager to outdo themselves. Be it in areas of governance or economy."

 tengri_events.59.d:0 "Some way back a number of our most pious Orthodox monks left the areas under our control in order to create a fortified frontier monastery in the wilder parts of the lands we border. The story of their success has attracted a number of believers to join them. Their settlement is now growing and will soon be noteworthy. Perhaps now would be a good time to claim the land for ourselves so that these settlers don't forget where they came from?"

 tengri_events.61.d:0 "A strange disease has struck [Root.Heir.GetName], a fever that our Shamans have been unable to stop or even alleviate. A visiting Sunni physician claims to recognize the condition and to be able to cure it. Our Shamans would likely take offense if we brought in an outsider after their own widely known failure but the life of our heir seems to be at its end unless we do something."

 tengri_events.62.t:0 "Protection of Pilgrims"

 tengri_events.63.d:0 "While [Root.Monarch.GetName] has limited the influence of the Khojas compared to some of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] predecessors they remain a powerful force in our lands and many of our subjects look up to the Khoja and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] family. This powerful faction in our country has never outright confronted us but their ever-present influence is slowly eroding our authority."
 tengri_events.63.a:0 "There is nothing to be done right now."

 maya_religion_events.1.t:0 "Nourish the gods"
 maya_religion_events.1.d:0 "Our country has reached an era of turmoil, and the gods demand blood. Rush to your cities and perform blood-letting to nourish and propitiate Tohil, god of war, sacrifice and sustenance. If you do not feed them, you will not be able to bring your disintegrating kingdom back from the brink of destruction."
 maya_religion_events.1.a:0 "I will lead our nobles in this and may my blood please Tohil."
 maya_religion_events.1.b:0 "The gods will get no blood from me!"
 maya_religion_events.2.t:0 "Blood Sacrifice"
 maya_religion_events.2.d:0 "Human energy is sent skyward and we receive divine power in return when we make a blood sacrifice. The king uses an obsidian knife or a stingray spine to cut his penis, allowing the blood to fall onto paper held in bowls. The queen pulls a rope with thorns attached through her tongue. The paper stained with blood is burned and the rising smoke communicates with the Sky World."
 maya_religion_events.2.a:0 "I do this gladly."
 maya_religion_events.2.b:0 "I will never do this."
 maya_religion_events.3.t:0 "Human Sacrifice"
 maya_religion_events.3.d:0 "Slaves and prisoners are a common sacrifice to the Mayan gods, but even animals such as turkeys, dogs, squirrels, quail, and iguana have been considered suitable offerings.

 maya_religion_events.3.a:0 "Try sacrificing animals."
 maya_religion_events.3.b:0 "Sacrifice children - as long as they are parentless."
 maya_religion_events.4.t:0 "Cycle of Creation and Destruction"
 maya_religion_events.4.d:0 "Our stories and myths tell of repeating cycles of creation and destruction which are reminders of the consequences that will happen if humans ever neglect their obligations to the gods. We have a responsibility to the gods who make our continued existence possible. The gods and other forces of creation and chaos fight each 52-year period which may bring the destruction of the worlds. If we ignore our duty to the gods, the battle between them that determines the fate of all earthly creatures might not end in our favor."
 maya_religion_events.4.a:0 "...and we the people can only cover in fear..."
 maya_religion_events.5.t:0 "Purification"
 maya_religion_events.5.d:0 "'A ritual shall always start with a purification,' the priest says to your heir. 'You become pure by fasting, bathing, and confessing, but you must also make sure to respect the gods. When entering the forest inhabited by a god, remember to drink water from a rock depression as soon as possible after you have entered the forest. The water must be spat on the ground and then you are free to continue into the sacred forest.'"

 maya_religion_events.6.d:0 "The Q'eqchi' thirteen sacred mountains, the large cenote in Chichen Itza and local shrines to various gods and goddesses attracts a lot of pilgrims, who need shelter, food and other necessary supplies.

 maya_religion_events.7.t:0 "Aluxob"
 maya_religion_events.7.d:0 "A farmer has managed to set an alux free, neglecting to seal it inside his house after seven years has passed since it was built. This has led to people complaining about missing items, lost animals and smaller injuries caused by the alux."

 maya_religion_events.7.b:0 "Don't bother me with such trivialities!"
 maya_religion_events.8.t:0 "Luck or Chaos?"
 maya_religion_events.8.d:0 "A peculiar man asks you for offerings as you were traveling through your kingdom. You have a faint suspicion that this might be an alux, who will wreak havoc and spread illness if their demand is refused. If they are given what they want, the alux will protect from thieves and bring luck."
 maya_religion_events.8.a:0 "Give him less than he wants and send him away."

 maya_religion_events.9.d:0 "A dream about the Hero twins, who were conceived when their mother spoke to a severed head who spat upon her hand. That severed head was their father, who together with his brother was summoned to Xibalba after their ball game had disturbed the peace of the Lords of the Underworld. The twins had many adventures before they themselves were summoned to Xibalba as their ball game disturbed the lords once again. The dream was about the many trials the twins faced before they reached the Lords of the Underground, and how they managed to defeat the lords. The dream ended when the twins transformed into the sun and moon which is a sign that a new age is beginning."
 maya_religion_events.9.a:0 "Shall we fear it, or welcome it with open arms?"
 maya_religion_events.10.t:0 "Hot Embers and Cold Evil"
 maya_religion_events.10.d:0 "It is customary that men walk over a bed of glowing embers that represents the fires of the Underworld to ward off evil during the year, but the smell of sizzling feet is not attractive."

 maya_religion_events.11.a:0 "It's an omen!"
 maya_religion_events.12.t:0 "Sacrificial Traditions"
 maya_religion_events.12.d:0 "It is time to decide how we should sacrifice the human offerings and there are several different ways to choose from. Decapitation, heart extraction, arrow sacrifice, disembowelment or throwing the offering into a cenote. What should we choose? The decapitation of the offering is done in a ritual reenactment of the decapitation of the Maya maize god by the Maya death gods, while the heart extraction is inspired by the Aztecs. The heart is pulled out while it is still beating, blood smeared upon the image of the temple's deity and the corpse skinned. The arrow sacrifice begins with the offering being painted blue with a white symbol over its chest, then bound to a stake during a ritual dance while wearing a peaked cap. Blood is drawn and smeared upon the deity's image and the dancers then takes turn shooting arrows at the offering until its whole chest is filled with arrows. Disembowelment is a slower death but not as elaborate, a sacrifice is bound to a stake with his hands tied behind his head and then disemboweled. The offerings can also be thrown into our Sacred Cenote."

 maya_religion_events.12.e:0 "Disembowel them!"
 maya_religion_events.12.f:0 "Hurl them into a cenote!"
 maya_religion_events.13.t:0 "Ixtab"
 maya_religion_events.13.d:0 "Our country is suffering and our priests have started suggesting that honoring Ixtab would be a good idea. Rope Woman, as she is also called, is the goddess of suicide and will accompany those who die by hanging to paradise. It is an honorable way to die and those who choose it will join people who died as soldiers or as sacrificial victims, women who died in childbirth and members of the priesthood. These enjoy a delectable existence and are rewarded with delicious food and drink. Wouldn't it be preferable to the chaos your country is currently experiencing, to rest instead under the shade of a pleasant tree, free from all want?"
 maya_religion_events.13.a:0 "Sacrifice [Root.Heir.GetName]"
 maya_religion_events.13.b:0 "Sacrifice yourself."
 maya_religion_events.13.c:0 "Find another solution."
 maya_religion_events.14.t:0 "Lack of Quetzal feathers"
 maya_religion_events.14.d:0 "Quetzal feathers are lacking and the fire deity Tohil, the sun god and the god of rain, cannot be properly celebrated unless quetzal feathers are sacrificed to him. He is our god of war, sacrifice and sustenance, and we do not wish his anger upon us. Traders have told us that there are Quetzal feathers in abundance in a neighboring country, and we should send someone to purchase the feathers from them."
 maya_religion_events.14.a:0 "Yes, send a trader to them."

 nahuatl_events.1.d:0 "After intense study of the skies and the relevant calendars our priests agree that everything indicates that harsh and troubling times are ahead.

 nahuatl_events.2.d:0 "Word has reached us of the birth of an exceptional child in [Root.Owner.Capital.GetCapitalName]. After almost two days of labor a boy has been born from a commoner woman but astrologers and other diviners agree he is destined for greatness. As is tradition his mother will soon bring him to the house of youth to introduce him to those who will later handle his martial education from puberty to the age of marriage."
 nahuatl_events.2.a:0 "The Telpochcalli will make a fine warrior out of him."

 nahuatl_events.3.d:0 "The young boy that was born under such favorable stars 15 years ago has now reached adulthood and the time has come for him to go into battle. As with other boys of his age he is expected to bring back his first prisoners soon, marking the start of his career as a warrior.\nShould any of the boys fail to take a captive they will be forever marked as unfit to be warriors and will have to continue their days as men of little consequence."
 nahuatl_events.3.a:0 "The Omens favor this man, I am sure he will do well."
 nahuatl_events.3.a.tt:0 "The Warrior is sent to war to be tested."
 nahuatl_events.3.b:0 "Let us sacrifice some of our blood to aid him."
 nahuatl_events.3.b.tt:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] spills some of his blood, this will surely aid our warrior but if the warrior is defeated our ruler's reputation will be affected."
 nahuatl_events.4.t:0 "Thy home is not here, for thou art an eagle, a jaguar"
 nahuatl_events.4.d:0 "Proving all the signs correct the young warrior born all those years ago has already exceeded all expectations.

 nahuatl_events.5.t:0 "Thou wilt merit death by the Obsidian Knife."
 nahuatl_events.5.d:0 "Despite the very favorable omens it seems the young warrior born all those years ago has been captured by the enemy. Soon he will face his destiny at the sacrificial stone in their capital. While this is an honorable death the disappointment of his house is great."

 nahuatl_events.9.t:0 "Commoner Flaunting his Wealth"
 nahuatl_events.9.d:0 "One of the expert artisan Tolteccas often employed by $MONARCH$ and other affluents in our society has attempted to rise above his social status. As a commoner he is expected to only hold a modest celebration when a child is born yet after the birth of his son last month he held a banquet worthy of at least a minor noble. While it is not wrong for a commoner to acquire wealth, flaunting it in this way is a great insult to our gods and traditions."
 nahuatl_events.9.a:0 "This is an affront to the gods. The Artisan must die."
 nahuatl_events.9.b:0 "His work is too important for him to die."
 nahuatl_events.10.t:0 "Incident during Nemontemi"
 nahuatl_events.10.d:0 "A noble of one of our most prominent families was found drunk in the street today. Not only is this a terrible affront to the gods, punishable by strangulation, but it happened during the time of Nemontemi when all disturbances of the peace are strictly forbidden."

 nahuatl_events.13.t:0 "Sorcerer Caught"
 nahuatl_events.13.d:0 "The sorcerer spreading fear in our lands has been caught. The traditional punishment for a man like him would be to cut his hair, robbing him of his magical powers. As this man has managed to cause much more harm than the average countryside conjurer however perhaps it would be better to punish him by death immediately to placate gods and men alike."

None of this involved remain to tell the tale but the rumor that has been spreading is that the man was a true Tlacatecolotl and that an owl was seen leaving his cell.

 nahuatl_events.16.d:0 "A great disaster has befallen us. This morning $HEIR$ was missing. One of the child's servants insists that the perpetrator was a Cihuateotl bearing resemblance to a woman that died giving birth nearby recently. That such a dark creature would be able to spirit away our heir in the middle of the night is surely a sign that the end of the world draws nearer."

 nahuatl_events.18.d:0 "During the time in his house of youth [Root.Heir.GetName] became quite adept at the traditional Ollamalitzli ball game, but as an adult he has had to give up on this habit. As the game is played throughout the different districts of [Root.Capital.GetName] however [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] is often seen as a spectator at the various courts near temples or markets even as an adult. This habit must also extend to participation in the wild betting that is often associated with the game as [Root.Heir.GetName] has come to you today asking for help to pay [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] debts."
 nahuatl_events.18.a:0 "Help [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] out"
 nahuatl_events.18.b:0 "Forbid [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] from participating again."
 nahuatl_events.19.t:0 "Prisoner Stolen"
 nahuatl_events.19.d:0 "Battles between warriors are always individual affairs and it can be hard to keep track of exactly when or how each and every prisoner is taken. Recently some warriors observed one of our most experienced fighters sneaking away with a captive of another warrior. If the prisoner was stolen then it is one of the gravest offenses possible for a warrior, punishable only by death. Even worse, many suspect that the captor deliberately reassigned his prisoner to his comrade."
 nahuatl_events.19.a:0 "Kill the accused."
 nahuatl_events.19.b:0 "Kill them both."

 nahuatl_events.21.d:0 "As part of the grander Tlacaxipehualiztli festival this year the foremost among the captured warriors will be pitted against four of our best eagle and jaguar warriors while tied to a sacrificial stone and armed only with a mock Macuahuitl, a club with feathers instead of obsidian blades. In the unlikely event that the captive should survive the encounter with his first four adversaries he will face one final, left-handed, fighter. Apart from pleasing the gods this ceremony is immensely popular and is likely to attract a great number of spectators."
 nahuatl_events.21.a:0 "Let the fight begin."
 nahuatl_events.21.b:0 "Let's keep to a more modest celebration."
 nahuatl_events.22.t:0 "Uncooperative Warrior"
 nahuatl_events.22.d:0 "Despite rigorous preparations the captive warrior that was supposed to fight at the gladiatorial stone today has proven less than cooperative. While the temple compound was filled to its brims with spectators the man refused to do battle and had to be struck down quickly by his first opponent. This has cast a long shadow over the entire celebration this year and some view it as a bad omen."
 nahuatl_events.22.a:0 "Thus giveth the sun to drink."
 nahuatl_events.23.t:0 "A Great Spectacle."
 nahuatl_events.23.d:0 "The battle between our four champions and the captive warrior has exceeded all expectations. Not only did the captive survive the first four encounters, it almost looked as if he might have had a chance to beat the final, left-handed, opponent he then faced.\nAs is customary after the captive warrior was finally defeated his heart was sacrificed to the gods while his flesh was given to the captor's family to consume and his skin will be worn by the captor himself for many days.\nThe celebrations of this year's Tlacaxipehualiztli are likely to be remembered for years to come."
 nahuatl_events.23.a:0 "Thus giveth the sun to drink."
 nahuatl_events.24.t:0 "End of the celebrations"
 nahuatl_events.24.d:0 "The Feast of the Flaying of men is now over and with it a new planting season begins. The extravagant celebrations this year will likely be remembered for a long time to come."

 nahuatl_events.25.t:0 "Tlacaxipehualiztli - The Feast of the Flaying of Men"
 nahuatl_events.25.d:0 "As the spring equinox and the planting season draws near the time of the Tlacaxipehualiztli is upon us. The time has come to sacrifice all prisoners of war at the temple of Xipe-Totec. Their blood will feed the sun and their skins will be worn by their captors and the priests of the temple before being saved in the holy cave.\nAs we have not fought any wars recently however we have an acute shortage of prisoners to sacrifice. This is in itself a bad omen and things will likely only get worse if we are unable to spill more blood today."
 nahuatl_events.25.a:0 "We must make do with the prisoners we have."
 nahuatl_events.25.b:0 "Let our subject states provide prisoners."
 nahuatl_events.26.t:0 "Pochteca Spies"
 nahuatl_events.26.d:0 "The rich Pochteca trade guilds are essential to the trade network of Mesoamerica and their members are generally free to cross our borders as they please.

 nahuatl_events.27.d:0 "The Pochteca Trade Guilds based in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] have come to us asking that we punish [From.GetName] for harassing their members. Apparently the Tlatoani of [From.GetName] claims that the Pochtecas have been spying on our behalf and has used this as an excuse to confiscate their goods."
 nahuatl_events.27.a:0 "I am shocked!"
 nahuatl_events.28.t:0 "Great [Root.Culture.GetName] Poet"
 nahuatl_events.28.d:0 "The spoken word has always had a special significance to our people, songs and recitations feature prominently in all our religious and profane ceremonies and even our highest leaders are referred to as Tlatoanis, speakers. Oral poetry is therefore one of the most sacred forms of art and one of few accepted ways in which a person can express dissatisfaction, anxiety and even doubt about fate itself without angering the gods.\nRecently an immensely popular Nahuatl poet has arrived in [Root.Capital.GetName], praising our city and its people but criticizing the Tlatoani himself."
 nahuatl_events.28.a:0 "He pleases the gods and the people."

His property and authority will remain what it was during his life and the mummy will continue to be the head of his lineage from now on.\nPanacas of former rulers often remain the most influential groups in high society and it is rare for a new ruler to rise without their support.

Many of his ancestors and even the god of the sun himself have married this way within the family and kept the bloodline pure. The boy's mother however refuses to hear of this and will not give her consent.\nThe proper way to solve this schism would be to ask our ancestor, the mummy that is the head of our Panaca lineage for guidance."

As [Root.Monarch.GetName] approaches the huge temple of a local Huaca god, a mummy of dynasty long gone, the royal priests urge caution. This is an unusually popular Huaca and if we are seen to honor the Huacas of our subjects too clearly we would be giving them too much power and authority.\nOn the other hand this Huaca is said to be very powerful and its popularity along with the favors it might provide are very enticing."

As is often the case this Huaca also happens to be a mummified ancestor of his own lineage. While the chief seems content to acknowledge our authority it is hard to shake the notion that he is attempting to build a bigger power base for himself in [Root.GetName].\nThe priests of Inti in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] strongly advocate that we remove the Huaca to put this chief in his place."

It has therefore been decided that a great temple of Inti should be constructed here as a natural centre for the spiritual and administrative life of the region.\nThe leader of the construction has presented [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] with two different plans for the temple. The first plan is to construct the temple at a Tincuy, the sacred confluence of two streams, while the other plan calls for making use of an old Huaca shrine as the base of the new temple."

As Mitmaq are not allowed to change the way they speak, the clothes they wear and have to take all their property with them, these people have never stopped to yearn for their original homes.\nAs it happens their area of origin is also under our control and a delegation from the Mitmaq has therefore been sent before [Root.Monarch.GetName] claiming that their Huacas have told them to return, begging us to lift their obligations."
 inti_events.17.a:0 "Allow the Mitmaq to Return."
 inti_events.17.b:0 "They are needed where they are."
 inti_events.18.t:0 "Priests Inciting Unrest in [Root.GetName]"
 inti_events.18.d:0 "The priests of a minor Huaca god in [Root.GetName] have been trying to inflame opinions against our rule by saying that we are slowly attempting to increase the authority of Inti and marginalize that of all the Huaca Gods. Luckily most of our subjects know better than to listen to these wild accusations but one of [Root.GetName]'s tribes supports the priests and have now demanded that we give them guarantees for the safety of their Gods and their people."
 inti_events.18.a:0 "The time has come for these people to move on, as Mitmaq."

 inti_events.29.d:0 "There is great distress in our lands. People are suffering and many fear for the future. In times like these an Itu celebration for the entire kingdom might lighten the minds of our subjects. The sacrifices it entails will also make the Gods more listen to our plights.\nFor this festival our priests are urging that we undertake a human sacrifice as the plight of our people have been great and they feel a grand ceremony is necessary to placate the gods."

This honor is in itself not a guarantee of martial prowess however. After a tour in the provinces it is clear to [Root.Monarch.GetName] that the quality of the guard could be dramatically improved if we brought in some new blood from the countryside.\nThis would however not be well received by the families currently given the privilege, at least not until the new members have been integrated for a few generations."

The punishment for treason is clearly death but the nobility of [From.Capital.GetCapitalName] would clearly not feel any less threatened if we killed their sons.

 fetishist_flavor.1.d:0 "Our warriors have been intrigued by the people of this region and their deep spirituality - the elders here speak of inner balance, respecting the Earth, and to seek transcendence. A key element in their belief seems to be in the Orishas, which are spirits or manifestations of something akin to divinity, ever present in the daily life of their followers. There is also speak of ‘Atunwa’, reincarnation within the family, and the ceremonies surrounding the stages of life are held in high reverence.\n\nSome of the lost souls in our armies have begun to meditate and seek comfort in one of the most revered Orisha - ‘Yemoja’, the Mother of Waters."
 fetishist_flavor.1.a:0 "Interesting."
 fetishist_flavor.2.t:0 "The Watchful Pangool"
 fetishist_flavor.2.d:0 "We have come across a people who worship the heavenly god of ‘Roog’, the Master of the World. They say Roog is the beginning and the end of all things, so sacred that the followers are not even permitted to craft images depicting the omnipresent god. Nor do they speak directly to this Creator in their prayers, or when asking for divine favor. Instead they turn their efforts to ancient spirits called the Pangool, the mediators between worlds. Some of these Pangool are said to be the spirits of a person's ancestors and to be accepted by them when one dies is what allows one to pass into ‘Jaaniiw’, the nocturnal realm and sacred dwelling of the soul. \n\nSome of our warriors are fascinated by the myths of these people - to make sure they won't end up as lost wanderers between realms they have turned to, as local tradition begs, leaving offerings at the feet of tall trees in honor of the Pangool."
 fetishist_flavor.2.a:0 "Fascinating!"
 fetishist_flavor.3.t:0 "The Children of the Architect"
 fetishist_flavor.3.d:0 "‘If I call one, I call all’, a worshiper can be overheard. They are often found praying by the rivers and streams of the area, the believers in Nyame, the Sky Father. They believe in the soul of animals and plants, in ‘Abosom’, lesser spirits encircling our plane of existence, and they communicate with their ancestors through ornate ritual.\n\nMost of all, this society appears to consist of a people of strong community. When recounting the deeds of their ancestors they sometimes speak of themselves as one - some of our scholars attribute this oddity to mistranslation, while others argue that these followers see themselves as something larger than one, as part of a common spirit, especially within one's own family. ‘They are like a two-headed crocodile, with one stomach - they do not fight one another for food’, our advisors suggest."
 fetishist_flavor.3.a:0 "Intriguing."
 fetishist_flavor.4.t:0 "The Future of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 fetishist_flavor.4.d.a:0 "In preparation of battles to come, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] recently went to see [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] Babalawo. The father of mysteries possesses wisdom of the Orunmila and any insight into the destiny of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] ‘Ori’, is always welcome. The diviner left [Root.Monarch.GetName] confused however, as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was told that [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] heir [Root.Heir.GetName] somehow will bring [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] a premature death. A battle? Poison? An accident? \n\n'Which will it be?' the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] demanded to know, but the signs were not clear - dealing with the matter is now a choice of the utmost delicacy."
 fetishist_flavor.4.d.b:0 "In preparation of battles to come, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] recently went to see [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] seer. The mysterious elder possesses great wisdom and any insight into the destiny of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is always welcome. The diviner left [Root.Monarch.GetName] confused however, as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was told that [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] heir [Root.Heir.GetName] somehow will bring [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] a premature death. A battle? Poison? An accident? \n\n'Which will it be?' the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] demanded to know, but the signs were not clear - dealing with the matter is now a choice of utmost delicacy."
 fetishist_flavor.4.a:0 "Have the heir taken care of."
 fetishist_flavor.4.a.tt:0 "Warriors will be impressed by this decisiveness."
 fetishist_flavor.4.b:0 "[Root.Heir.GetName] is but a child. This is nonsense."
 fetishist_flavor.4.b.tt:0 "People will be unimpressed by the indifference displayed by their ruler."
 fetishist_flavor.4.c:0 "Have the heir [Root.Heir.GetName] taken care of."
 fetishist_flavor.4.d:0 "This is nonsense."
 fetishist_flavor.5.t:0 "The Road from [nonchalant_neighbor.Capital.GetCapitalName]"
 fetishist_flavor.5.d.a:0 "A cousin of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has passed away. The letter sent to us describes how a bandit ambush fell upon the entourage of the traveling statesmen and how they were all forced off a cliff on their way home from a visit in [nonchalant_neighbor.Capital.GetCapitalName], in our neighboring nation of [nonchalant_neighbor.GetName]. The few possessions that could be retrieved have been sent to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], but the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] is distraught by the death of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] favorite relative. To make matters worse, the letter from [nonchalant_neighbor.GetName] says nothing about whether a proper funeral ceremony has been considered or not.\n\nDo they wish us ill with this Oku igbe, a bush death, for the kin of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]?"
 fetishist_flavor.5.d.b:0 "A cousin of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has passed away.

To make matters worse, the letter from [nonchalant_neighbor.GetName] says nothing about whether a proper funeral ceremony has been considered or not.\n\nThe dear cousin will soon be reborn, either into the visible or the invisible world, but the thought of the good woman not receiving the correct funeral rites torments the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] who is left alone, pondering [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] mortality."
 fetishist_flavor.5.d.c:0 "A cousin of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has passed away.

Yet the thought of the good woman not receiving the correct funeral rites torments the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 fetishist_flavor.5.a:0 "We must retrieve the body and see to the rites."
 fetishist_flavor.5.a.tt:0 "We send our thanks, hire men to venture into [nonchalant_neighbor.GetName], and pay for the ceremonies required ourselves. May [Root.GetCult] give the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] strength."
 fetishist_flavor.5.b:0 "This mockery of our faith will not stand."
 fetishist_flavor.5.b.tt:0 "The rulers of [nonchalant_neighbor.GetName] will receive an angry letter."
 fetishist_flavor.5.c:0 "These are tough times for all of us."
 fetishist_flavor.5.c.tt:0 "We let it go. [nonchalant_neighbor.GetName] will receive a letter with our thanks for informing us of the events."
 fetishist_flavor.6.t:0 "The Anger of the [From.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 fetishist_flavor.6.d.a:0 "We have received a belligerent letter from our neighboring nation of [From.GetName], apparently in response to some of our diplomats informing the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of a tragic bandit attack involving [From.GetAdjective] statesmen. It would seem that one of the victims of the calamity was a relative of the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] and [From.Monarch.GetSheHe] is outraged that the information relayed neglected any mention of the sacred rites to be issued for [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] kin.\n\nThe worship of [From.GetCult] requires more than our ambassadors assumed."
 fetishist_flavor.6.d.b:0 "Our neighbors in [From.GetName] have sent us a hostile warning in response to some information we relayed to them recently regarding a bandit attack on some [From.GetAdjective] statesmen. The root of the ill feelings appears to stem from something about funeral rites not being properly performed, or possibly the retrieval of the bodies not being seen to? It's hard to tell from the messy jumble of insults that makes up the letter. The worship of [From.GetCult] is apparently rather complicated...?"
 fetishist_flavor.6.a:0 "It is of no concern to us."
 fetishist_flavor.6.a.tt:0 "Fellow children of [From.GetCult] or not, we can't be bothered with every small thing in this world."
 fetishist_flavor.6.b:0 "It is of no concern to us."
 fetishist_flavor.6.b.tt:0 "The children of [From.GetCult] aren't that different from us, but we cannot cater to their every whim."
 fetishist_flavor.6.c:0 "There's no pleasing some people."
 fetishist_flavor.7.t:0 "The Pool Becomes a River"
 fetishist_flavor.7.d.a:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] has been more at peace since the funeral of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] cousin was seen to. The ceremony was even attended by diplomats from [nonchalant_neighbor.GetName]. Relieved by the knowledge that [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] relative is safe in the arms of the Goddess Yemoja, the songs still echo in the mind of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].\n\n‘But when you see a Kob antelope on the way to the farm,\nWhen you see the Kob antelope on the way to the river –\nLeave your arrows in the quiver,\nAnd let the dead depart in peace.’"
 fetishist_flavor.7.d.b:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] has been more at peace since the funeral of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] cousin was seen to. The ceremony was even attended by diplomats from [nonchalant_neighbor.GetName] and the knowledge that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s relative has moved safely onto the next stage of her journey to the shadow world brings the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] great comfort.\n\n‘You will be remembered for generations, my friend’, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] says, before turning to smile at the Sky God."
 fetishist_flavor.7.d.c:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] has been more at peace since the funeral of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] cousin was seen to. The elaborate ceremony was even attended by diplomats from [nonchalant_neighbor.GetName]. The knowledge that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s relative received all the rituals required to maintain balance with the spirits has brought the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] great comfort.\n\nIn the evening a light breeze runs through [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s chambers, making [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] smile - the Sky God has many ways of making their presence known. ‘Then we are still together’, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] says, before drifting off to sleep."
 fetishist_flavor.7.a:0 "Blessed be the departed."
 fetishist_flavor.7.a.tt:0 "All owned Fetishist provinces get '§YSerenity of Faith§!' for five years, giving the following effects:\nMorale of Armies: §G+15.0%§!\nRecruitment Time: §G-20.0%§!"
 fetishist_flavor.8.t:0 "The Sons of Nyame"
 fetishist_flavor.8.d.a:0 "The people of [tormented_province.GetName] find themselves in a state of confusion after one of their most valued members of society has fallen ill. Confined to her bed, one influential village elder has not stirred from slumber in over a week. Our advisors suggest that we encourage the locals to prayer, but to whom should the lost souls be turning to? On the one hand we have Tano, the river god and son of Nyame, said to race to your side against Death in the final hours of your life. On the other hand, Anansi the Trickster could perhaps be convinced to lend his aid as well, in exchange for something valuable?"
 fetishist_flavor.8.a:0 "They should turn to Tano, the river deity."
 fetishist_flavor.8.a.tt:0 "There is no guarantee that praying will have any effect.\n"
 fetishist_flavor.8.b:0 "They should turn to Anansi the Trickster."
 fetishist_flavor.8.b.tt:0 "The people might at least feel better from having performed all the sacrifices they could.\n"
 fetishist_flavor.9.t:0 "The Slithering Pangool"
 fetishist_flavor.9.d:0 "A rumor from [heathen_province.GetName] tells of a giant snake moving into a tree, right in the middle of a village square. While the locals were alarmed at first, the animal has made no attempt to hurt anyone, and has instead gained some social status among the inhabitants, who have begun calling it by pet names... Finally, a wise woman from the area has declared the snake sacred, saying the creature is for certain a spirit taken serpent form, which has encouraged people to bring it sacrifice and food."
 fetishist_flavor.9.a:0 "The Pangool is here to aid us."
 fetishist_flavor.10.a:0 "Ok."
 fetishist_flavor.11.a:0 "Ok."
 fetishist_flavor.101.t:0 "The Cwezi Heroes of Kitara"
 fetishist_flavor.101.d:0 "There was a time when the Cwezi ruled these lands, as their Empire, Kitara, encompassed all that is known to men. In our travels we have come across an increasing number of peoples that claim to be the heirs of Kitara cherishing these heroes of old. The spirits still exist in the world around us, in nature and in our minds and some can communicate with the Cwezi through oracles and diviners. In their lands we have come across groups of wandering priestesses who have the power to channel these spirits and through them disease, infertility and misfortune can be mitigated. There are those who devote their entire lives to these lost ancestors and their sanctuaries. All worldly authority must flow from ties to the past and no one can be fit to rule without a direct link to the Cwezi spirits."
 fetishist_flavor.101.a:0 "Interesting."
 fetishist_flavor.102.t:0 "The Cult of Mlira"
 fetishist_flavor.102.d:0 "We have come across a people that venerate and worship their own ancestors as gods. Through powerful oracles they can constantly keep in touch with their predecessors and by ensuring their graves and shrines are in good order they can be ensured the ancestors themselves have the power to carry on protecting them."
 fetishist_flavor.102.a:0 "I want to learn more..."
 fetishist_flavor.103.t:0 "The Supreme Creator"
 fetishist_flavor.103.d:0 "'Once there was nothing, then Mwari created the world and brought man out of a hole in the ground. Mwari created the mountains and Mwari can make them tremble with his voice. Mwari lit the fires known to men and Mwari causes the rain to fall. Mwari is the father and the mother of humankind and will guard us in adversity.'\nWe have come across an increasing number of followers of Mwari recently. They all have in common that they refuse to acknowledge any other spiritual power than their one god and while they speak freely and gladly of his existence they guard the secrets of the cult itself carefully."
 fetishist_flavor.103.a:0 "Nyadenga - Musikavanahu - Muvambapasi"
 fetishist_flavor.130.t:0 "The Voice of our Ancestors"
 fetishist_flavor.130.d:0 "The Royal Oracle has come bearing good news. After completing the grand ceremonial dance required to contact our most revered ancestors to consult them about the coming year it seems we are in for a bright future. Details are hard to come by through the shroud of death but this can only mean good things."
 fetishist_flavor.130.a:0 "We shall undoubtedly reap the rewards for years to come."
 fetishist_flavor.130.b:0 "This proves our close ties to those that came before us."
 fetishist_flavor.131.t:0 "Caring for Those That Came Before Us"
 fetishist_flavor.131.d:0 "The care of our ancestral shrines remains a constant challenge to our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. It has been suggested that the best way to handle this would be to appoint one of our most loyal ministers to be the permanent care-taker of the shrines, with an associated budget. As long as our finances could support it this would have few drawbacks, at least as long as we have someone we can trust to do it..."
 fetishist_flavor.131.a:0 "I know just the right person for this!"
 fetishist_flavor.131.b:0 "I wouldn't trust anyone but myself."
 fetishist_flavor.132.t:0 "Ruler Questioned"
 fetishist_flavor.132.d:0 "Appointing someone to be the head of our ancestral shrines has generally been a successful move. The shrines themselves are in good order and our official has also become so closely associated with these spirits that he has been able to create a new set of ceremonies for their worship, in close cooperation with the oracles. Indeed he is now expected to speak for them himself in some regards.\nHowever, it seems our care-taker has started to value his loyalty to the ancestors above that to his [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. He has lately been lobbying for an increase in the budget to keep our holy shrines. It is hard to see a reason to go against the ancestors on this but it is unfortunate that someone feels he can speak for them against us..."
 fetishist_flavor.132.a:0 "Agree to increase the shrine budget."
 fetishist_flavor.132.b:0 "It's time we take the power over our ancestors back!"
 fetishist_flavor.133.t:0 "Favor of $RANDOM_OLD_MONARCH$"
 fetishist_flavor.133.d:0 "Sometimes the deeds performed in a lifetime are of such caliber that everyone can see what awaits. Diviners agree that $RANDOM_OLD_MONARCH$ was of such high caliber that [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is an insufficient title and that we should rather speak of a god or deity. Our people speak of $RANDOM_OLD_MONARCH$ with veneration and have already begun to worship their lost [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and those who channel this spirit."
 fetishist_flavor.133.a:0 "Praise be $RANDOM_OLD_MONARCH$!"
 fetishist_flavor.150.t:0 "Mwari, the one god"
 fetishist_flavor.150.d:0 "While we have accepted the nature of Mwari as our sole creator and the origin of all power it seems not all of our subjects are as convinced of his greatness. In [Root.GetName] widespread veneration of their own ancient local spirits has become too sincere for the sensibilities of our priests."
 fetishist_flavor.150.a:0 "We must show them the way."
 fetishist_flavor.150.b:0 "We can be a bit lenient for now."
 fetishist_flavor.150.c:0 "He is the owner of the land!"
 fetishist_flavor.151.t:0 "Mwari and the Mhondoro Spirits"
 fetishist_flavor.151.d:0 "While Mwari is the creator of all, and the origin of all power he has a number of subordinate spirits that help him control the world. Similarly a great ruler must rely on subordinate chiefs to run the day-to-day business of the various villages of the realm. As long as we lead a life in accordance with the will of Mwari we can also be sure of the support of the Mhondoro spirits. It therefore comes as no surprise that the diviners of [Root.GetName] have reprimanded the local chiefs and strengthened our hold on the region."
 fetishist_flavor.151.a:0 "He is the owner of the skies!"
 fetishist_flavor.152.t:0 "Wrath of Mwari"
 fetishist_flavor.152.d:0 "In the recent upheaval in [wrath_of_mwari.GetName] local chiefs under our command have seen fit to punish captured enemy leaders by execution. In doing so however they did not consult the diviners of Mwari and have broken a number of his rules. While it is clear to most that these men acted without our official sanction the fact that neither we nor the spirits of Mwari could control them has created a widespread unrest. Especially as locals are claiming that Mwari himself has spoken to show his great dissatisfaction with the way things have transpired."
 fetishist_flavor.152.a:0 "We will try to do better."
 fetishist_flavor.153.t:0 "The faith of [Root.GetName]"
 fetishist_flavor.153.d:0 "The local chief of [Root.GetName] is loudly protesting the policies of our [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] as he claims we are ignoring the voice of Mwari and his deputies. The chief on the other hand claims to have had a close liaison with the local diviners and their Mhondoro spirit. As unlikely as it sounds others have begun to join him in protest and it seems but a matter of time before an open revolt is upon us."
 fetishist_flavor.153.a:0 "We will have to show them the error of their ways."
 fetishist_flavor.154.t:0 "Royal Fires"
 fetishist_flavor.154.d:0 "A realm such as ours relies on a certain amount of delegation. Fortunately our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is an excellent judge of character and we also have Mwari and his deputies to help us select and control our realm.\nEven so it is customary for the various chiefs of the realm to come to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] to report and make a show of their loyalty once per year. In a grand ceremony the chiefs are expected to relight their royal fires and bring them back to their province as a sign of their ties to us and to Mwari. It is therefore with great irritation that we note that some of our chiefs this year have neglected to come, instead sending feeble excuses about distance."
 fetishist_flavor.154.a:0 "We can afford to let them opt out."
 fetishist_flavor.154.b:0 "If we allow this, more will follow."
 fetishist_flavor.170.t:0 "Plight of [Root.GetName]"
 fetishist_flavor.170.d:0 "Our people in [Root.GetName] are concerned that the Cwezi spirits are upset with their conduct in the area. According to popular belief there's been a sharp decline in the number of pregnancies and an increase in birth complications which is being attributed to the recent neglect of a minor shrine in [Root.GetCapitalName]."
 fetishist_flavor.170.a:0 "There is nothing we can do."
 fetishist_flavor.170.b:0 "We must enlist the help of the Cwezi priestesses."
 fetishist_flavor.170.b.tt:0 "By empowering the Cwezi priestesses and enlisting them to consult with the spirits and perform the ritual of initiation on local women we stand a good chance to avert a local disaster."
 fetishist_flavor.170.c:0 "We must offer [Root.Owner.Consort.GetName] to the Cwezi Spirit."
 fetishist_flavor.170.c.tt:0 "As the spouse of the Cwezi Spirit [Root.Owner.Consort.GetName] will be able to act on our behalf and stop this. She will however be unable to serve as the queen of our country ever after."
 fetishist_flavor.171.t:0 "Support of the Spirits"
 fetishist_flavor.171.d:0 "The Cwezi ancestors have answered our pleas for help and it is widely accepted that the area around [Root.GetName] no longer suffers from the horrible infertility curse that once afflicted it."
 fetishist_flavor.171.a:0 "We have successfully averted the pending disaster in [Root.GetName]."
 fetishist_flavor.172.t:0 "Spiritual Abandonment"
 fetishist_flavor.172.d:0 "The Cwezi spirits remain unimpressed by our efforts to enlist their help against the horrible fertility plague that has hit [Root.GetName]. Our people are fleeing the area hoping to avoid the horrible curse that according to the widespread belief would make them unable to bear children."
 fetishist_flavor.172.a:0 "We have been tried and found wanting."
 fetishist_flavor.173.t:0 "Itinerant Sorceress"
 fetishist_flavor.173.d:0 "A group of priestesses led by a powerful sorceress has arrived in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] seeking our hospitality. Through the secret ways of spirit possession they can parlay directly with the great Cwezi spirits of old. Refusing their request for hospitality is not really an option - the kind of support we give to this group will likely influence the kind of support we can expect for our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 fetishist_flavor.173.a:0 "We can only offer meager accommodations but expect little in return."
 fetishist_flavor.173.b:0 "Let us remind our people of our close ties to Kitara."
 fetishist_flavor.173.c:0 "Offer healing and consolation to all those who need it in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]."
 fetishist_flavor.174.t:0 "Bad Omen"
 fetishist_flavor.174.da:0 "The diviners of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] are having visions of impending destruction. They assure us that the Cwezi spirits of old Kitara will do what they can to protect us but we can be sure that dire times are ahead."
 fetishist_flavor.174.a:0 "Dark words..."
 fetishist_flavor.174.b:0 "The diviners will stand between us and the heroes of old."
 fetishist_flavor.175.t:0 "Spirit Shrine"
 fetishist_flavor.175.d:0 "The representative of one of the largest shrines in our country has sought an audience with our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] asking us to fund an extension and acquire more priests for the Cwezi spirit that resides there. According to the custodian this shrine, while not neglected, is not fit to house our great ancestors and they have let us know that we cannot expect great things as long as we don't do something about this.\nThis would be a worrying thing in itself but it also seems a local demagogue has latched on to this. With [Root.Monarch.GetName] being so vilified by local clergy it's hard not to suspect the two of cooperating."
 fetishist_flavor.175.a:0 "We will give the priestess free hands."
 fetishist_flavor.175.b:0 "I refuse to be manipulated!"
 fetishist_flavor.201.t:0 "The People of Enkai"
 fetishist_flavor.201.d:0 "We have come across a tribe who fervently worships a deity whom they call ‘Enkai’, the Man in the Sky. They seem to place a tremendous importance on cattle and every man counts his wealth in cows, bulls and calves. One cowherd we met told us about the legend of Enkai and the gift he sent to their people. \n\nThe story goes that Enkai was once a human and that his herd contained all the cattle in the world. When the sky was torn from the earth, he sent his herd back down to his people along a bark rope. A tribe of jealous hunters who coveted the meat cut the rope and now the cattle is the only remaining link to Enkai. These people claim to be Enkai's chosen ones and thus all the cattle under the skies belong to them."
 fetishist_flavor.201.a:0 "We will seek out more knowledge of Enkai and his blessings."
 fetishist_flavor.202.t:0 "God of the Sky"
 fetishist_flavor.202.d:0 "Lately we have encountered people who fervently worship ‘Waaq’, whom they claim to be the supreme and all-powerful ruler of the Universe. If their words are to be believed, he created the world and resides in the Heavens from where he watches over us all. Mankind is subject to his will and must always worship and fear him. \n\nThe follows of Waaq pray for peace and harmony above all other things. They believe that the world balances atop the horns of a great bull. Standing in front of him, tied to a pole, is a cow. The equilibrium of the Universe is tied to the love between the bull and the cow. Should she turn away from him, the bull would become anxious and thus the world would shift. This could lead to all manners of disasters on Earth. However as long as we pray and offer gifts to the great Waaq, we shall be safe. At least that is what these people claim."
 fetishist_flavor.202.a:0 "Teach us more about the mighty Waaq."
 fetishist_flavor.203.t:0 "The Divided God"
 fetishist_flavor.203.d:0 "As we expand our horizons and encounter new communities we learn of other deities and ways of life. Recently words have reached us of the god ‘Zanahary’. He is the Creator of the Universe, split in two - he is both male and female, Light and Dark, Heaven and Earth. The heavenly Zanahary breathes life into the clay bodies shaped by the earthly Zanahary, thus creating humans. When the two sides of Zanahary argue, the breath is withdrawn from the body, resulting in mortality and death.\n\nThe followers of Zanahary do not seem to be all that worried by this, however. They tell us that life is only a temporary state and that the dead are the most important members of the community. The ancestors, or ‘razana’, are described as gods on earth and act as a mediator between the living and Zanahary."
 fetishist_flavor.203.a:0 "Intriguing! We must learn more about Zanahary and the razana."
 fetishist_flavor.204.t:0 "Praying for Rain"
 fetishist_flavor.204.d.a:0 "The wet season is approaching and we have received words from the province of [rain_province.GetName], asking for our assistance. Working the lands is essential to the local economy of [rain_province.GetName], as well as that of surrounding areas, however they have not been blessed with sufficient rainfall during the last few years. Surely the farmers are already praying to Waaq for a fertile fields and a bountiful harvest, however the local Wadaad priests believe an organized celebration would prove more effective. They are stressing how vital this year's harvest will be for the future prosperity of the region."
 fetishist_flavor.204.d.b:0 "The wet season is approaching and we have received words from the province of [rain_province.GetName], asking for our assistance. Working the lands is essential to the local economy of [rain_province.GetName] as well as that of surrounding areas, but during the last few years, they have not been blessed with sufficient rainfall.

By sheer luck, they have not offended anyone too important so far, although we should be careful. Many are pointing fingers at the seidkonur, blaming our misfortune on their spell. They believe that Freyja was displeased that we would rather talk than fight our way through war, but the seeresses insist that they are not to blame."
 fetishist_flavor.416.t:0 "The Fourth Path"
 fetishist_flavor.416.d:0 "The wise Buddha taught us to follow the Noble Eightfold Path in order to be released from the eternal cycle of death and rebirth. The Fourth Path, ‘Samyag Karman’ or Right Action, says that we must not perform sensual misconduct, take that which is not ours, injure or kill. In many ways, Samyag Karman has made our nation stable and prosperous, but it does have its disadvantages. As not to displease the Buddha, monks in the [no_killing_province.GetName] province have been encouraging our subjects not to join the army. At first their influence was negligible, however over time the word has spread and we are starting to feel the consequences."
 fetishist_flavor.416.a:0 "Staying true to the Noble Path is an honorable endeavor."
 fetishist_flavor.416.a.tt:0 "Allow the men who want to follow the Noble Path to stay out of the army."

 fetishist_flavor.417.t:0 "The Spirit of Generosity"
 fetishist_flavor.417.d:0 "In order to grow as human beings and approach spiritual liberation, we must earn merit. According to the teachings of the Buddha, we do so through good deeds, acts and thoughts, and the accumulation of merit will carry over to our coming incarnations. The utmost sign of a good heart is the willing transfer of merit to others. This proves that we do not only perform good deeds, acts and thoughts for our own benefit, but for that of everyone else as well.\n\nOur great ruler, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], has arranged a great ceremony at the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family shrine. At the end [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] will pass on the merit which [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] gathered during the ritual. Whom shall [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] dedicate it to?"
 fetishist_flavor.417.a:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] ancestors, in order to ease their suffering in the next life."

 fetishist_flavor.418.t:0 "Returning to the Flock"
 fetishist_flavor.418.d:0 "Over a thousand years ago, the Israelites were exiled from the Promised Land and since then the children of Abraham have been spread across the world with no real realm to call their own. Over time, our traditions and practices have changed and diverged. We ourselves only recently found our way back to Igziabeher and are now fiercely protective of our own emerging Haymanot identity. \n\nA big tribe of wanderers have recently arrived in the [Root.GetName] province. While they also claim to be the descendants of Abraham, and many of their customs mirror our own, there are certain differences. When they pray, they do so to ‘Yahweh’ and the scripture they carry is named the ‘Torah’. They have requested to settle here under our protection. While many of them are skilled craftsmen and wise scholars, resources which would without doubt benefit our nation, our advisors warn us about the friction which is certain to appear between these newcomers and our current subjects…"

 fetishist_flavor.419.t:0 "Demand of the Jews"
 fetishist_flavor.419.d:0 "While they were certainly grateful at first, the Jewish population of [Root.GetName] has been growing increasingly discontent. The friction between them and the Haymanot subjects has caused us many sleepless nights. The Jews have also begun to complain about the lack of influence that they have in the nation's affairs, now that they have become a part of it. They demand that one of their leaders, the guild master Isaiah, shall be given a seat on the council of advisors. While it would surely satisfy the Jews, we would also weaken our religious authority and anger our more fanatical subjects."
 fetishist_flavor.419.a:0 "We shall happily accept Isaiah's wise counsel."
 fetishist_flavor.419.b:0 "Have we not given you enough? Ungrateful leeches..."
 fetishist_flavor.420.t:0 "Desecration of the Sanbat"
 fetishist_flavor.420.d:0 "On the Seventh Day after Igziabeher had created the world, He rested. In His honor, we keep the seventh day of the week holy. During the Sanbat, from sundown the day previous until the stars emerge, we do not work, write or cook. We even do not light any fires. Desecrating the Sanbat is a crime against God's laws. \n\nWord has gotten out that one of our most trusted advisors, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName], often works during Sanbat. While some of the more extreme protesters demand that [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] be stoned to death for [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHis] sinful ways, we do not want to set a dangerous precedent. After all, [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] is not the only one at court to violate the Sanbat, even though [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetSheHe] is the most regular and least discreet culprit. Simply firing [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHim] would surely appease the majority, although [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHis] experience would make it a great loss…"
 fetishist_flavor.420.a:0 "We cannot allow such a poor moral character to represent our government."

 fetishist_flavor.450.t:0 "The Nature of God"
 fetishist_flavor.450.d:0 "Our veneration of the Christian God has generally brought us much closer to the [christian_neighbor.GetAdjective] but there's always a slight feeling that we are talking past each other rather than about the same things when it comes to matters of theology. This was even further highlighted today when during a joint ceremony of state our ambassador in [christian_neighbor.GetName] got into a heated argument about the nature of the Holy Trinity. The [christian_neighbor.GetAdjective] quite clearly take offense at the way the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost are worshipped in our lands."
 fetishist_flavor.450.a:0 "Something must have been lost in translation?"
 fetishist_flavor.450.b:0 "Apologize and attempt to mend the disagreement."
 fetishist_flavor.451.t:0 "The Greater Christian Community"
 fetishist_flavor.451.d:0 "To the greater Christian World our veneration of their God must seem like a miracle. While they may take issue with some of our interpretations there seems to be a general relief that the word of God can be spread among the pagans. Wherever they go our diplomats seem to be greeted with open arms."

A constant trickle of merchants, priests, monks and adventurers is now, among other things, helping spread the word of God in our lands.\nA group of missionaries from [christian_missionary_origin.GetName] now wishes to settle in [Root.GetName]."
 fetishist_flavor.452.a:0 "What harm could come from welcoming men of God?"
 fetishist_flavor.452.b:0 "We must maintain control over the faithful ourselves."
 fetishist_flavor.452.b.tt:0 "By refusing the missionaries we will avoid foreign Christian sects spreading in our lands but we will anger their country of origin."
 fetishist_flavor.455.t:0 "A Far-Away Traveler"
 fetishist_flavor.455.d:0 "A learned Qadi, well schooled in Islamic jurisprudence has seen fit to grace our country with his visit. It seems he is traveling through the Islamic world to bring order and structure to the legal system and observe the various ways in which the life and words of the prophet are thought. While it is a great honor for such a man to visit [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] it would perhaps be even more beneficial if we could convince him to stay..."

In [Root.GetName] however the new religion has a great number of practitioners, some who feel our theology is a bit on the liberal side. A recent influx of converts from the less religiously orthodox part of the country has created notable tensions. In order to control his subjects our local representative has brought even more recent converts as soldiers which has only inflamed the situation further. It seems but a matter of time before violence erupts..."

 fetishist_flavor.460.d:0 "Word has spread among the various exiled Zoroastrian communities of our veneration of the Mazdayasna faith. The fire temples of [Root.GetCapitalName] have attracted particular fame, and now great numbers of Zoroastrians have begun to arrive in the area to start a new life in what they hope will be a more hospitable land.\nWhile some find it disconcerting that the province is so quickly losing touch with the traditions of our ancestors the steady stream of scholars, merchants and other valuable men and women will certainly help the area grow."

 fetishist_flavor.461.d:0 "Over time an increasing number of fire temples have been consecrated using the original fire that was brought to us by the followers of Zoroaster. As the faith becomes more common however it has also managed to anger some of our more traditionally oriented of our subjects. A fire temple consecrated quite close to the shrine of one of the more venerated ancestors in [Root.GetName] has led to open hostility between the followers of the old ways and the 'Magi' from the east. The traditionalists have stormed into the temple and extinguished the holy fire."

 fetishist_flavor.500.d:0 "Our elders worry that peace and good fortune has made recent generations of our community deteriorate - they say our warriors have grown soft and the minds of our scholars dull. ‘This is not what Teotl worship should look like’, they argue. To placate these learned members of our society we could arrange for a building be built, to house scholars and diviners to map the stars. We could also perform a blood sacrifice, in the name of the Sun God."

 fetishist_flavor.502.d:0 "The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] of our magnificent [Root.GovernmentName] stepped up to the altar with fierce determination. The setting sun glinted in the obsidian blade [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] held and the chanting of the priests intensified. As [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] made a deft cut down the length of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] arm, the crowd cheered. The blood still dripping from [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] nodded solemnly to the elders seated in the audience. One of them smiled as a queue of eager warriors began to form to the altar."
 fetishist_flavor.502.a:0 "For the Sun!"
 fetishist_flavor.503.t:0 "The Architecture of Failure"
 fetishist_flavor.503.d:0 "Bad weather and poor management has led workers to lay down their tools and give up the construction of an observatory.

The disgruntled members of the elder council shake their heads."

 fetishist_flavor.504.t:0 "Under the Scrutiny of the Ancestors"
 fetishist_flavor.504.d:0 "The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] nervously stepped up to the altar. The blade quivered in [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] hand while the crowd held their breath. Closing [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] eyes [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] then pressed the dagger into [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] skin... \n\nThe cut [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] placed must've gone deep because the blood that flowed onto the stone floor quickly painted it red as it dripped down the steps. The liquid glistened in the embers of twilight and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] just had time to hear the priests replace their chant with gasps before [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] passed out.\n\nWhen [Root.Monarch.GetName] awoke again, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was not quite the same."

 fetishist_flavor.505.t:0 "Golden Idols"
 fetishist_flavor.505.d:0 "A fine craftsman of golden jewelry has gained some renown in our lands. His popularity has allowed him to expand his workshop substantially and he has already taken several apprentices under his wing. Our nobility is especially intrigued by his specialization in delicate golden idols - representing various gods and kept for divine protection, they come in the form of snakes, eagles, and jaguars. Unsurprising, it has become the highest fashion to keep these totems close, preferably as a pendant around one's neck."
 fetishist_flavor.505.a:0 "How charming!"
 fetishist_flavor.506.t:0 "The Unity of Blood"
 fetishist_flavor.506.d:0 "This morning [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] received a missive from one of the elders in [worried_province.GetName], assuring us of the benefits of a grand sacrifice to the Cloud Serpent.\n\nThere is no denying that the weather these past months have been unusually dry, particularly in [worried_province.GetName]. The people there worry about their crops while the local elders are voicing their opinion more loudly each day - their diviners have been predicting this for months, they say, questioning the nonchalance and lack of faith of the villagers. There is a strange air of elitism brewing among the elders as some scoff at the anxious farmers now seeking their council.\n\nLooking over the missive again, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is puzzled. Perhaps an elaborate ceremony is precisely what is needed to stabilize the region?"
 fetishist_flavor.506.a:0 "Order an extravagant ceremony of blood!"

 fetishist_flavor.507.t:0 "Under a Cold Moon"
 fetishist_flavor.507.d:0 "The moon hung ominously in the sky above the crowd, the faces of the priests lit red by light from their torches. The air was silent, save for the shuffling of feet, leading up to the altar - a dozen men were being led, or dragged, towards the center stage of the ceremony. [worried_province.GetName] has rarely seen such ritual and it was clear that this would have an impact on the crowd, young and old, nervously watching. After having spent a month in silence, the high priest finally called out pleadingly to the gods as an unfortunate villager was held down on the altar. His heart, along with those of the other sacrifices, was about to be cut out of his body, ‘set free’ to join the spirits."
 fetishist_flavor.507.a:0 "We should do this again sometime."

Were those rain clouds? \nThe intended gifts to the Cloud Serpent shrieked and wept in protest as they were dragged to the stage of the ceremony. The tension lay heavy and one elder shifted his weight nervously.\nSuddenly the sky cracked with thunder and rain began to pour down on the scene. The crowd broke into chaos as screaming and shouting filled the air - some villagers were struggling to rescue their loved ones from being sacrificed in vain! The ceremonial knife, risen in terrified defense by the high priest, came slashing down in panic at people as the venerated elders attempted to flee the stage."
 fetishist_flavor.508.a:0 "Terrible news!"
 fetishist_flavor.510.t:0 "A Blessed Guru"
 fetishist_flavor.510.d:0 "We have heard accounts of a lowborn man, possessing a calming presence and a way with words, while he also appears wise in the ways of philosophy. His fellow men treat him with the utmost respect, as if he was of the Brahmin caste. A curiosity, the man shuns earthly possessions and never asks for more than the opportunity to preach his insight to others - in fact he has become something of a local attraction as people seek his aid in all sorts of matters, ranging between those of the heart to those of agriculture or civic duty. Some of the nobility argue that he’ll start charging money for his advice any day now, while others see him as clearly meant for something other than spending the remainder of his life meditating in the local temple."
 fetishist_flavor.510.a:0 "Make him our entrusted advisor."
 fetishist_flavor.510.b:0 "He should remain in his village temple."
 fetishist_flavor.511.t:0 "Sacred Writing"
 fetishist_flavor.511.d:0 "[dharmic_neighbor.GetName] have sent us a furious letter, informing us of a [Root.GetAdjective] monk selling books within their borders, while passing them off as sacred texts. Not only is it obviously counterfeit material, but the writing also contains several errors in regards to the Hindu worldview, and the authorities in [dharmic_neighbor.GetName] are accusing us of trying to instigate religious riots in their streets. There is the argument that the monk was simply trying to explore his own philosophy, but considering the popularity of the writings in [dharmic_neighbor.GetName], it is reasonable to assume that this monk is indeed a charlatan using our faith to make money...\n\nThe damage already done, all we can do is send troops to find and escort the monk out of the country of [dharmic_neighbor.GetName]."
