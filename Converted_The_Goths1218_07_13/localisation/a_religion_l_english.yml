 nahuatl_reform_1:0 "Open up Sumptuary Restrictions"
 nahuatl_reform_1_desc:0 "Our society has traditionally restricted the use of finer clothing, jewelry or even the amount of stories a house may have to the hereditary nobility. By opening up these perks to anyone who performs well on the field of battle we can create a state where every member of our society is ready to do their part in times of war."
 nahuatl_reform_2:0 "Extend Pochteca Obligations"
 nahuatl_reform_2_desc:0 "The Pochteca trade guilds have often come to act as our emissaries, diplomats and spies in relations with other city states. Let us formalize this relationship into a set of strict obligations to more efficiently handle our foreign relations."

 inti_reform_1:0 "Organized Recruitment"
 inti_reform_1_desc:0 "While our subject peoples have always supplied troops for our armies they have done so to varying degrees and in an ad-hoc manner. By formalizing the need for every subjugated area to supply soldiers to the central state we will be able to tap the manpower resources of our lands in a much more efficient manner."
 inti_reform_2:0 "Expanded Mitma Policy"
 inti_reform_2_desc:0 "The policy of moving entire villages from loyal areas into newly conquered land or into the frontier has helped expand the empire. This type of forced resettlement could also be used to resettle the population of newly conquered areas into the core parts of the empire. Strict laws should be put in place to forbid people from returning to their original homes."
 inti_reform_3:0 "Reform the Cult of Inti"
 inti_reform_3_desc:0 "While Inti, the sun, is the foremost of all gods most of the peoples of the Andes also worship a variety of minor Huacas.

A unified army structure would ensure that less resources are wasted."
 mesoamerican_reform_2:0 "Central Arbitration"
 mesoamerican_reform_2_desc:0 "While they are unified under our rule, the city states of our empire frequently get into conflict with each other over everything from trade rights to border demarcation. By creating a central arbitration authority we can greatly reduce these tensions."
 mesoamerican_reform_3:0 "Central Armories"
 mesoamerican_reform_3_desc:0 "In times of war it has been customary for the city states of Mesoamerica to arm the commoners in order to raise armies big enough to challenge their neighbors. As each state has its own armories the type and quality of arms can vary a lot within the empire. By creating a central system of armories from which all armies are equipped we can drastically increase the quality of our armed forces."
