 harem_events.1.da:0 "His Imperial Majesty [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], sovereign of the house of Osman, Sultan of Sultans and Khan of Khans has a reputation as a great man and is unchallenged as a ruler.\nAs befits a man of his caliber and stature the Sultan has fathered several capable children and many who show great promise as future rulers. As both the sons themselves and our government officials are aware however only one can inherit and there is little in the way of consolation prizes. Our Viziers are adamant that it is now high time for [Root.Monarch.GetName] to name a favorite among the possible successors. This is unlikely to end the competition for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] favor but it will hopefully stop the worst succession struggles that might follow if our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] should meet his maker without having picked a clear successor."

 harem_events.2.d:0 "An Ottoman coronation ceremony is the most grand thing many will see in their lifetime and the coronation of [Root.Monarch.GetName] is no exception. As the Sword of Osman is girded upon [Root.Monarch.GetName] by the Sharif of Konya however our Viziers look upon [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] with some amount of dread. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] was never the most likely of candidates and would likely never have taken the throne if a clear favorite had existed. Some would go as far as to say that it was [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] mediocrity that allowed [Root.Monarch.GetName] to triumph. Greater men never considered [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] a threat and others hoped to control the Empire through [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. One thing our new [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has clearly demonstrated: When the need arises [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] will not shy away from sinking a dagger in the back of those that trust [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]."
 harem_events.2.a:0 "Long live the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]!"
 harem_events.2.a.tt:0 "Only time can tell what kind of a ruler §Y[Root.Monarch.GetName]§! will be."
 harem_events.3.t:0 "Sancaga çikma"
 harem_events.3.d:0 "Our favorite and heir, [Root.Heir.GetName], is young and still has a lot to learn about life and how to be a good ruler. Most of our Viziers feel it is our duty to uphold our dynastic tradition of appointing our sons to act as governors and rulers over small provinces. This way they can learn what it is to be a ruler. By assigning suitably powerful provinces we can also reduce the chance of a future succession struggle. [sancaga_cikma_province.GetName] has served as such a governorship at times in the past and would likely fit [Root.Heir.GetName] very well.\nOthers, including our Mother, the Valide Sultan, feel that young [Root.Heir.GetName] would benefit the most from an education within the walls of the Imperial Harem, where [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] will have constant access to good teachers and can be supervised by those who know him. This way [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] would also be far from any place [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] might develop premature political ambitions."
 harem_events.3.a:0 "Governing [sancaga_cikma_province.GetName] will do [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] a lot of good."
 harem_events.3.a.tt:0 "§Y[Root.Heir.GetName]§! will be given full control over §Y[sancaga_cikma_province.GetName]§! and if all goes well may return with improved abilities as a ruler."
 harem_events.3.b:0 "The Imperial Harem is the perfect place for a young [Root.Heir.GetWomanMan]!"
 harem_events.3.b.tt:0 "§Y[Root.Heir.GetName]§! will remain in §Y[Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]§! where it is safer in all respects but will not have a chance to increase [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] abilities as a ruler."
 harem_events.4.t:0 "Sancaga çikma"
 harem_events.4.d:0 "[Root.Heir.GetName] has returned from [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] time as a governor. According to [Root.Heir.GetHerselfHimself] the experience has enriched [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] in more ways than one and [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] is more ready than ever to succed when God calls for our revered [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. If our favorite did learn something, that is not very apparent to us however and in the Harem rumors are circulating that the only way [Root.Heir.GetName] enriched himself was by lining his pocket during the local revenue collection."
 harem_events.4.a:0 "All is well then."
 harem_events.4.a.tt:0 "§Y[Root.Heir.GetName]§! is older, wiser, but generally the same person he was when he was sent away."
 harem_events.5.t:0 "[Root.Heir.GetName]'s bid for the Throne"
 harem_events.5.da:0 "Acting as a province governor can undoubtedly teach many valuable lessons for those who will one day rule an empire. It can also give a first taste of real power. Rumors about disease spreading in the Topkapi Palace must have reached [Root.Heir.GetName] and rather than investigate or pray for our health [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] decided that this was an excellent opportunity to seize what was rightfully going to be his eventually."

 harem_events.5.a:0 "Treason!"
 harem_events.6.t:0 "The years in [heir_governorship_province.GetName]"
 harem_events.6.d:0 "[Root.Heir.GetName] has returned to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] from [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] term as a governor of [heir_governorship_province.GetName]. [Root.Heir.GetSheHeCap] claims these years have taught [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] many things about what it means to be the head of a government and how our provincial system works on the local level. During [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] time away from [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] has had ample time to lead the local troops, oversee the administration and juggle the local strongmen."
 harem_events.6.a:0 "Excellent..."
 harem_events.7.t:0 "Fear of the Silk Cord"
 harem_events.7.d:0 "As the practical details of succession are being handled for [Root.Monarch.GetName] news has reached us from [enthronement_or_death.GetName]. It seems one of the brothers of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] Imperial Majesty would rather go down fighting than risk the traditional procedures of a lost succession. His name has been read during the Friday prayers in [enthronement_or_death.GetName] and in short time an army has been assembled to overthrow our new [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 harem_events.7.a:0 "Kill them. Kill them all."
 harem_events.8.t:0 "Death of the Valide Sultan"
 harem_events.8.da:0 "Ever since [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was a young Sehzade in the Imperial Harem [Root.Monarch.GetName] has had [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] mother by [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] side. She has offered advice and protection throughout [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] career and as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] ascended the throne she remained one of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] closest confidants and most influential advisors. Even though she was by now a very old woman the news of her death has come as a heavy blow to our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] who has now lost a good friend, and advisor and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] mother all at once."
 harem_events.8.db:0 "Ever since he was a young Sehzade in the Imperial Harem [Root.Monarch.GetName] has had his mother by [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] side. She has offered advice and protection throughout [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] career and as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] ascended the throne she remained one of his closest confidants and most influential advisors. The news of her untimely death has come as a surprise and a heavy blow to our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] who has now lost a good friend, an advisor and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] mother far too soon."

 harem_events.8.a:0 "The Empire shall mourn her for three days."
 harem_events.8.b:0 "We must set aside lands for a charitable foundation in her memory!"
 harem_events.9.t:0 "Rites of Passage"
 harem_events.9.d:0 "Like the Sultans of old [Root.Heir.GetName] hopes to make a name for [Root.Heir.GetHerselfHimself] as a conqueror and a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] who will lead the Empire from the horseback. As [Root.Monarch.GetName] is still in good health, and as we have not allowed our heir to actually take to the field, the realization of this dream remain an uncertainty. It has come to the point that [Root.Heir.GetName] is being ridiculed by the other Sehzade and [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] mother is imploring [Root.Monarch.GetName] to give [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] a command of [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] own.\nThis is not an unreasonable request, though one must wonder about the motives of those that try to goad our favorite to risk [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] life and limb."
 harem_events.9.a:0 "This will do [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] good."
 harem_events.9.b:0 "The Harem is much safer."
 harem_events.10.t:0 "Treachery within the Family"
 harem_events.10.d:0 "Word has reached us that the beloved and most favored of sons, [Root.Heir.GetName], is plotting against [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] father and aims to overthrow the state. Our trusted and closest consort, the Haseki Sultan, implores us to cut off this cancer from our body and have [Root.Heir.GetName] murdered.\nThere can be no doubt that the Haseki Sultan speaks out of her own interest in this matter, [Root.Heir.GetName] is no son of hers but his replacement is very likely to be. Our own ministers also speak of [Root.Heir.GetName]'s betrayal however and he could pose a very real threat."
 harem_events.10.a:0 "[Root.Heir.GetName] must die..."
 harem_events.10.a.tt:0 "Send assassins to kill §Y[Root.Heir.GetName]§!.\nIf they fail this will provoke a revolt regardless of his guilt."
 harem_events.10.b:0 "Summon [Root.Heir.GetName] to defend himself."
 harem_events.10.b.tt:0 "If the rumors are true this will give §Y[Root.Heir.GetName]§! time to assemble a bigger army."
 harem_events.10.c:0 "I will not listen to such lies!"
 harem_events.10.c.tt:0 "§Y[Root.Consort.GetName]§! falls from grace.\nIf the rumors are true this will give §Y[Root.Heir.GetName]§! time to assemble a bigger army."
 harem_events.11.t:0 "[Root.Heir.GetName] is Innocent"
 harem_events.11.d:0 "Given time to present his case [Root.Heir.GetName] has fully convinced our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of his innocence and will remain the most favored of our heirs. This entire ordeal has strengthened his standing at court and with the public in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]."
 harem_events.11.a:0 "I'm not one to be fooled so easily."
 harem_events.12.t:0 "The Plot of [Root.Heir.GetName]"
 harem_events.12.d:0 "The time afforded by our indecisiveness was sufficient for [Root.Heir.GetName] to be able to assemble the rebel army he had intended. As the sun sets on the seventh day after his discovery an army is marching towards [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]."
 harem_events.12.a:0 "Yes son?"
 harem_events.13.t:0 "The Fate of a Vali Ahad"
 harem_events.13.d:0 "The assassins we sent to kill the Vali Ahad have returned after successfully completing their mission. We shall never know if he was guilty of treason or not."
 harem_events.13.a:0 "A great tragedy."
 harem_events.14.t:0 "The Fate of a Vali Ahad"
 harem_events.14.d:0 "The assassins we sent to kill the Vali Ahad failed to perform their mission. Our former heir has fled the capital together with a group of his closest supporters and now prepares to fight for their lives."
 harem_events.14.a:0 "A great tragedy."
 harem_events.15.t:0 "Prince-Governor on the Frontier"
 harem_events.15.da:0 "True to our Turkic heritage we have allowed a number of the Sehzade to serve as governors of various provinces around our empire. The current war against the infidel [enemy_neighbor_ottomans.GetAdjective] has allowed the prince-governor of [ottoman_prince_here.GetName] to really prove his worth as a military commander and a Ghazi. According to reports he has gone to great lengths to defeat the enemy troops in his area, bringing the battle to the other side of the border. The faithful are flocking to his banners and the military elite and the Ulema has begun to take note and may well end up supporting him in a future succession struggle."

 harem_events.15.a:0 "He's proven himself worthy to be our new favorite."
 harem_events.15.b:0 "He's proven himself a true son of Osman."
 harem_events.15.b.tt:0 "The standing of §Y[Root.Heir.GetName]§! is decreased slightly due to his opposition growing stronger."
 harem_events.16.t:0 "Support of the Valide Sultan"
 harem_events.16.d:0 "Our naming of [Root.Heir.GetName] as the preferred heir and Vali Ahad has been about as popular as one could expect among the other Imperial princes and their mothers. Even so [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] ascension has been far less smooth than one could have hoped for, something many would blame our Haseki Sultan, [Root.Consort.GetName] for.\nHowever, determined to stop such destructive intrigue the Valide Sultan, mother of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] Imperial Highness [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] has stepped in to protect [Root.Heir.GetName]."
 harem_events.16.a:0 "Thanks Mother!"
 harem_events.17.t:0 "Conflict between [Root.Consort.GetName] and the Valide Sultan"
 harem_events.17.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName]'s most favored Consort, the Haseki Sultan, and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] mother, the Valide Sultan, are women of great influence and ambition. Both also control a faction of their own in the Imperial Harem and while they both claim to have the best interests of [Root.Monarch.GetName] at heart a clash of wills have always been inevitable. [Root.Consort.GetName] has been maneuvering to have one of her sons take [Root.Heir.GetName]'s place as heir, but the Valide Sultan will have none of it. Both women have invested considerable prestige in the conflict by now."
 harem_events.17.a:0 "Side with the Sultan's mother."
 harem_events.17.a.tt:0 "Siding with the Valide Sultan is expected of us and will give some prestige. §Y[Root.Consort.GetName]§! will be outmaneuvered however and a new consort will take her place as Haseki Sultan."
 harem_events.17.b:0 "Side with [Root.Consort.GetName]."
 harem_events.17.b.tt:0 "By going against the advice of the Valide Sultan, §Y[Root.Monarch.GetName]§! will lose her support."
 harem_events.17.c:0 "Avoid taking sides."
 harem_events.17.c.tt:0 "The conflict will fester and weaken the claim of our current favorite heir."
 harem_events.18.t:0 "Ambitions of the Valide Sultan"
 harem_events.18.d:0 "As many of the Sultan's before [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has a very close bond with [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] mother. As it please God the Valide Sultan is a powerful ally, friend and confidant for our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and to reflect this she has been granted a most generous allowance. Money that apart from being used for her personal needs she has been putting to use for the betterment of the state. Our mother is not content with this however and has asked for an even more generous arrangement that would allow her to fund ambitious building projects in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] itself."
 harem_events.18.a:0 "Anything for you."
 harem_events.18.b:0 "She's doing great work but needs to know her limitations."
 harem_events.19.t:0 "Influential Haseki Sultan"
 harem_events.19.d:0 "[Root.Owner.Consort.GetName] has not only caught the heart of the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] she is also a dynamic woman in her own right. Her constant work to strengthen [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName]'s realm is a boon both to [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHim] and [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] subjects.\nRecently a number of charitable projects funded by [Root.Owner.Consort.GetName] in [Root.GetName] and its surroundings has made the entire area blossom."
 harem_events.19.a:0 "Such a great woman."
 harem_events.20.t:0 "[Root.Consort.GetName] Challenged"
 harem_events.20.d:0 "The Haseki Sultan is not only the favorite consort of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], she is also the mistress of the Imperial Harem and the most powerful woman in the Empire bar the Sultan Mother. Attaining and holding this position is the dream of every consort in the harem.\nIt should therefore come as no surprise that an ambitious and young woman has caught the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s eye..."
 harem_events.20.a:0 "We could never abandon [Root.Consort.GetName]."
 harem_events.20.b:0 "It's time dear."
 harem_events.21.t:0 "Competition for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 harem_events.21.d:0 "As [Root.Monarch.GetName] has yet to name a favorite among his consorts every one of them is maneuvering to take their rightful place alongside the Sultan. The Imperial Harem is rife with intrigue and right now making a well informed choice for the position of Haseki Sultan, one of the highest honors imaginable in the empire would seem all but impossible. Luckily [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s mother has a firm grip on the politics of the Harem and has presented [Root.Monarch.GetName] with a consort she feels would be a good candidate."
 harem_events.21.a:0 "Excellent!"
 harem_events.21.b:0 "I will make my own choices, mother..."
 harem_events.21.c:0 "Let us keep our options open."
 harem_events.22.t:0 "[Root.GetName] and the Royal Princes"
 harem_events.22.d:0 "As is customary some of our provinces are governed by imperial princes so that they may learn what it is to be rulers one day. It is also understood that these provinces can serve as their base of power when the time comes to see to the succession. That struggle itself often gives ample opportunity to sort out the bad eggs.\nSometimes however the process can be even more hasty. It seems one of our Prince-Governor's has managed to actively destroy the resources under his control. If nothing is done soon revenue will be permanently reduced. Unfortunately however the Royal Prince, while not our favorite does have support from some influential groups in [Root.Owner.Capital.GetCapitalName], if we are to withdraw his assignment there will be some backlash."
 harem_events.22.a:0 "Replace him immediately"
 harem_events.22.b:0 "Find an excuse to call him back eventually."
 harem_events.23.t:0 "To Play the King"
 harem_events.23.d:0 "As the age of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] advances [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] sons grow impatient. Unfounded rumors are regularly circulating of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] failing health and the various factions of the court are aligning with the many would-be heirs among [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] sons. For one the distance in the supposed line of succession was enough to risk the uncertainty of the rumor mill. In [revolter_prince.GetName] one of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s sons has taken up arms against [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]."
 harem_events.23.a:0 "Kill them all."
 harem_events.24.t:0 "[Root.GetName] Prospers"
 harem_events.24.d:0 "The administration of [Root.GetName] was recently turned over to be administrated by one of our imperial princes. What we had not expected is that he would be able to do so much so quickly. The local economy is prospering and the urban centers are attracting more merchants and artisans to settle in them. Revenue seems to have been permanently improved.\nSome would consider this an auspicious sign, perhaps we should elevate this son to be our new favorite?"
 harem_events.24.a:0 "This is just the man we're looking for."
 harem_events.24.b:0 "Let's not get ahead of ourselves."
 harem_events.24.b.tt:0 "This Prince's success lessens our favorite heir's claim to rule."

 parlaments.11.t:0 "[Root.GetName] changes stance in debate!"
 parlaments.11.d:0 "It seems the MP's of the seat of [Root.GetName], staunch supporters of our cause just a little while ago, have come to change their opinion of the currently debated issue entirely. We cannot know for sure how this happened but is clear that we can no longer rely on their vote."
 parlaments.11.a:0 "Greed is a horrible thing."
 parlaments.12.t:0 "Rotten Borough"
 parlaments.12.d:0 "While it looked like the vote of [Root.GetName] would in fact come out in support of the currently proposed reform to eliminate the Rotten Boroughs in our Parliament it seems whoever supported the MP in the area suddenly realized that he was about to lose his seat. He has now managed to convince the MP to vote against our reform."
 parlaments.12.a:0 "Rotten!"
 parlaments.13.t:0 "[Root.GetName] changes stance in debate!"
 parlaments.13.d:0 "A determined campaign by members of the administration in [Root.GetCapitalName] to oppose the changing of laws and regulations to accomodate integration of other systems into ours have succesfully convinced the MP from the area to oppose our proposition."
 parlaments.13.a:0 "Ok."
 parlaments.14.t:0 "[Root.GetName] changes stance in debate!"
 parlaments.14.d:0 "The MPs of [Root.GetName] have been convinced by those that hold interests in the production industries of the province to oppose opening the regulations that protect them from outside competition."
 parlaments.14.a:0 "Ok."
 parlaments.15.t:0 "[Root.GetName] changes stance in debate!"
 parlaments.15.d:0 "Many in [Root.GetName] have been quite dissapointed in the proposal to increase naval spending. They feel the area already contributes so much to the armed forces of our country and had rather expected the Parliament to authorize more funds for them than ask for more money for the navy."
 parlaments.15.a:0 "Ok."
 parlaments.16.t:0 "[Root.GetName] changes stance in debate!"
 parlaments.16.d:0 "The dominance of the navy in the province of [Root.GetName] has meant that the proposed increased spending on the army in Parliament has been rather coldly received there. Despite initially having been positive to the proposition the Members of Parliament from this area now see no choice but to vote against it."
 parlaments.16.a:0 "Ok."
 parlaments.17.t:0 "[Root.GetName] changes stance in debate!"
 parlaments.17.d:0 "While initially in favor, the MPs from [Root.GetName] have declared their disgust for the current issue. It signifies a far-reaching ambition of the state to own and control everything within its borders and they say they won't stand for it."
 parlaments.17.a:0 "You may very well think that. I couldn't comment."
 parlaments.18.t:0 "[Root.GetName] changes stance in debate!"
 parlaments.18.d:0 "The MPs of [Root.GetName] are surprisingly positive to our proposal in the parliamentary debate. It appears the university in [Root.GetName] is convinced it will be involved in the counting and measuring that the current proposal entails and scholars are delighted for the opportunity to take part of some new raw data regarding our country."
 parlaments.18.a:0 "Ok."
 parlaments.19.t:0 "[Root.GetName] changes stance in debate!"
 parlaments.19.d:0 "Voting in favor of increasing taxes has been a very tough sell in [Root.GetName]. After numerous protests the MP from the area has withdrawn his support for our proposition and is now opposing it fearing for his reelection."
 parlaments.19.a:0 "Ok."
 parlaments.20.t:0 "City Life"
 parlaments.20.d:0 "As representatives of areas that are sometimes quite distand from [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] many MPs often find that life in the capital during their visits is very different to what they are used to. Some find it both cramped and filthy and many seem quite relieved when they get to return home.\nThis year has proved even harder than usual to endure for the delicate sensibilities of our MPs. The hot months have been unusualy hot, the wet months unusually wet and the cold months unusually cold. A number of MPs have now decided that they have had enough and have approached us asking to help make their stays more pleasant."
 parlaments.20.a:0 "We must do what we can."
 parlaments.20.b:0 "They'll have to endure like the rest of us."
 parlaments.21.t:0 "MP in Scandal"
 parlaments.21.d:0 "A minor scandal has occured in the capital during the current debate. It seems rather than attend the sessions himself one of the MPs was out disturbing the public peace and harassing his landlady. The outrage is great both among his peers and in the street and is likely to haunt future parliaments for years."
 parlaments.21.a:0 "Let it slide."
 parlaments.21.b:0 "Arrest the MP."
 parlaments.22.t:0 "Absenteeism"
 parlaments.22.d:0 "Given its great influence over the politics of our country it would be easy to assume that all MPs attended parliamentary sessions with great enthusiasm, eager to do the most with the power they have been trusted with. This is however far from the case and in any given parliament there will be some that never show up, either because they are still enjoying their estates in the countryside or because they decide to partake in the many joys of the capital. The problem has grown more and more lately and we fear foreign dignitaries are laughing at us behind our backs. There are a number of measures that might be taken to increase attendence but none that the current MPs would take very kindly too."
 parlaments.22.a:0 "Fine the worst excesses."
 parlaments.22.b:0 "There's nothing we can do."
 parlaments.23.t:0 "Demands for Representation"
 parlaments.23.d:0 "A number of hostile publications have begun to circulate in the cities of [Root.GetName]. Anonymous, yet very critical, authors claim that our the government is 'Autocratic' and demand both a written constitution and a parliament where the various parts of our country can be represented."
 parlaments.23.a:0 "Ban the Publications"
 parlaments.23.b:0 "Make vague promises of Reform"
 parlaments.24.t:0 "Financial Aid"
 parlaments.24.d:0 "Due to the current poor government finances any contribution to the state coffers is very welcome. It is therefore with some enthusiasm that we receive the representatives of a number of rich city assemblies offering to help. Their price  however is greater representation in government in general and formalized ways for the state to ask for their help in the future."
 parlaments.24.a:0 "Grant them Greater Representation"
 parlaments.24.b:0 "Refuse their money."
 parlaments.24.c:0 "Promise to take their views in consideration."
 parlaments.24.dd:0 "Refuse their money."
 parlaments.25.t:0 "Demands of the [Root.Culture.GetName]"
 parlaments.25.d:0 "While our country lacks a national parliament, local assemblies exist since ancient times in many of our provinces. These have little influence outside of their own provinces but they will sometimes approach the state and their existance allows for a more efficient taxation of the provinces.\nLately trouble have been brewing in [Root.GetName] where a number of such provincial assemblies have recently begun to demand representation at a national level. They feel that they are poorly represented by the central government and that a central parliament where they could offer their opinions to the ruler would be the only way to alleviate this."
 parlaments.25.a:0 "We will think about it."
 parlaments.25.b:0 "Such ideas need to be crushed."
 parlaments.26.t:0 "Direct Contribution"
 parlaments.26.d:0 "Enthusiastic about the currently debated issue in parliament a group with their interest very much aligned to ours from [Root.GetName] have come to make a direct contribution to the state. It is their hope that the money can be put to good use to 'convince' any MPs that are still opposed or atleast compensate us for any such costs we have had up until now."
 parlaments.26.a:0 "I'm sure we will find a use for it."
 parlaments.27.t:0 "Parliamentary Traditions"
 parlaments.27.d:0 "One of the more difficult things about being a parliamentarian has nothing to do with the debates in the capital but rather how to sell the new laws to the people back home. Still a local MP will often have an easier time to explain a new tax than the collector sent by the central government would in less representative systems.\nIt seems the MPs in general and the ones from [Root.GetName]in particular have become so adept at defending policies that we can see a rise in the support of the central government as a whole as a result."
 parlaments.27.a:0 "They finally understand me!"
 parlaments.28.t:0 "Support of local Assembly"
 parlaments.28.d:0 "The local assembly in [Root.GetName] has been quite enthusiastic in their support of our current proposition in parliament. So much so that they have already begun with the necessary preparations for what they are certain will be a certain approval."
 parlaments.28.a:0 "Remarkable."
 parlaments.29.t:0 "[Root.GetName] changes stance in debate!"
 parlaments.29.d:0 "Citing their eternal loyalty to the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] and their full confidence in [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] ability to know what is best for our state the MPs of the seat of [Root.GetName] have come out in support of our position in Parliament. Their support for our cause is most welcome."
 parlaments.29.a:0 "Great!"
 parlaments.30.t:0 "[Root.GetName] changes stance in debate!"
 parlaments.30.d:0 "Citing their mistrust of [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] and [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] ability to know what is best for our state the MPs of the seat of [Root.GetName] have reversed their support of our position in Parliament."
 parlaments.30.a:0 "Their lack of trust is disturbing."

 free_cities.1.d:0 "The city of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] has been granted Imperial Immediacy as an Imperial Free City of the Holy Roman Empire.

 free_cities.3.d:0 "The constant discontent among the lower classes and our incapability to deal with it has brought us to the brink of riots. We are badly equipped to deal with this, and are urged to take the matter to the Emperor, to see if we can get some sort of help. Manpower and gold is what we need to extinguish the fires that smolder and rage in the streets of [Root.Capital.GetName]."

 free_cities.4.d:0 "The free city of [From.Country.GetName] and their problem with the lower classes has forced them to ask us for help. The messenger spoke of fires smoldering and raging in the streets of [From.Capital.GetName] as a metaphor for the discontent and likely rebels that the free city struggles with. They humbly ask for manpower and gold, so that they may be able to deal with this swiftly and efficiently."
 free_cities.4.a:0 "It's a reasonable request, and one we will honor."
 free_cities.4.b:0 "The problem is deeper within [From.Country.GetName] and until they realize that, we will not send help."

 free_cities.6.t:0 "The Coronation Occurrence"
 free_cities.6.d:0 "[PAP.Monarch.GetTitle] [PAP.Monarch.GetName] placed the Imperial Regalia in the hands of the new emperor of Holy Roman Empire, a symbol of the [PAP.Monarch.GetTitle]'s right to crown Christian sovereigns and the emperor's role as protector of the Roman Catholic Church. It was a great honor to be selected as the location for the coronation, and the church of [Root.Capital.GetName] could barely hold all the dignities that had gathered to see the emperor crowned."
 free_cities.6.a:0 "We are blessed indeed!"
 free_cities.7.t:0 "The Treaty Conference"
 free_cities.7.d:0 "After the Treaty Conference was over, the participants thanked us for our help in assisting them with all the necessary details which surrounds such an important event, and for our neutrality in this matter. This helped them focus on the task at hand. Though we were not monetarily compensated for anything more than the expenses made for the conference, we are now considered a more prestigious country than before."
 free_cities.7.a:0 "Worth all the hassle, then."
 free_cities.8.t:0 "Custom and Tax Privileges"
 free_cities.8.d:0 "One of the Free Cities in our vast empire is struggling, barely making enough money to keep itself away from the dreaded hole that is bankruptcy. Once they fall, they will have a hard time climbing out of the hole that they, unfortunately, has dug themselves. We could try helping them by granting them some custom and tax privileges that, if handled correctly, will allow them to make quite a bit of gold."

 free_cities.8.b:0 "They have not deserved this."
 free_cities.9.t:0 "Custom and Tax Privileges Given"
 free_cities.9.d:0 "The... news of us struggling by the brink of bankruptcy was a small surprise, but the big surprise was that [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] of [From.Country.GetName] had decided to help us by granting us certain common and tax privileges we doubt few other Free Cities have."
 free_cities.9.a:0 "As surprising as it might be, it is a great gift!"
 free_cities.10.t:0 "Wellborns with Weapons"
 free_cities.10.d:0 "Land-owning nobles in [Root.Capital.GetName] dislike our Free City status, and lately we have tired of trying to keep them happy. Had they been mere peasants, armed with pitchforks and torches and with little military training, we would be able to deal with any revolt they might produce. But these are men and women familiar with war and weapons of all sorts, and should not be underestimated. The only one they might listen to is the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire..."

 free_cities.12.d:0 "The nobles are getting bolder, and are now trying to engage the peasants and burghers to join their revolt against us and our status as a Free City. So far, they have had little success with this but we fear, as we always do when someone are trying to shatter the peace we fight so hard to keep. What will [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] of [From.Country.GetName] think of us? Will [From.Monarch.GetSheHe] help us with these unruly nobles?"

 free_cities.14.d:0 "We have heard of the Leagues of old, some of which still exists. The Hanseatic League, for example, where merchant guilds have created a commercial and defensive confederation, or the Swabian League which was a mutual defense and peacekeeping association. The Free City of [From.Country.GetName] has suggested that we join something similar, a cooperation of sorts, where we collaborate in matters of trade, keeping imperial peace, supporting tribunals and perhaps later the maintenance of a unified force."

#Devotion Events#

 devotion_events.1.t:0 "General Hospital"
 devotion_events.1.d:0 "A suggestion has been put forward to set up a general hospital, to create a place where the needy would be welcomed and assisted. The public health is very important, and to offer a free midwifery course and some establishments to combat disease would increase the well-being of everyone."
 devotion_events.1.a:0 "If this should improve the public health, then what are we waiting for? Do it!"
 devotion_events.1.b:0 "Prayer will solve all their problems, do not waste money on that!"
 devotion_events.2.t:0 "Fort Maintenance"
 devotion_events.2.d:0 "Our forts are the most important defense we have against intruders and enemies, but they are in great need of restoration. We would need to increase our taxes in order to fund this, and that will most certainly upset those who pay taxes."
 devotion_events.2.a:0 "We need this, ignore the rabble!"
 devotion_events.2.b:0 "Do what is possible with the money we already have."
 devotion_events.3.t:0 "Modernization of the Forts"
 devotion_events.3.d:0 "The forts no longer look as if they would crumble before our eyes, they are now sturdy enough to withstand most attacks to their walls. Their defenses, although now functional and impressive despite their age, are still lacking in comparison to other nation's forts. We would need to dig deep into the pockets of our taxpayers in order to be able to fund the upgrades and the modernization our forts sorely need."
 devotion_events.3.a:0 "It is for the greater good... who wants to be invaded?"
 devotion_events.3.b:0 "They are good enough as they are."
 devotion_events.4.t:0 "Too High Taxes"
 devotion_events.4.d:0 "It's hard to hear the citizens rage against the raised taxes from the high, high walls and inside the thick, thick towers of our restored forts, but we do hear them threatening revolt and rebellion unless we lower the taxes."
 devotion_events.4.a:0 "We hear, and we reluctantly oblige."
 devotion_events.4.b:0 "Say what? WE CANNOT HEAR YOU!"
 devotion_events.5.t:0 "Embellishment of Forts"
 devotion_events.5.d:0 "A gift of a stained-glass was placed in one of our forts, and the effect is exquisite. So exquisite, in fact, that we consider embellishing every fort we own with our sigil in stained-glass."
 devotion_events.5.a:0 "Vanity is a sin, even if it is for a fort!"
 devotion_events.5.b:0 "Just increase the taxes to pay for it."
 devotion_events.6.t:0 "The Quest for Religious Freedom"
 devotion_events.6.d:0 "A man known for his radical ideas about religious reforms is condemning the priests and the [Root.Religion.GetName] doctrines in his sermons. This has led to widespread complaints and demands for religious freedom from our not-so-loyal citizens."
 devotion_events.6.a:0 "Our country is [Root.Religion.GetName] and will always be [Root.Religion.GetName]!"
 devotion_events.6.b:0 "Concede full religious freedom to the city."
 devotion_events.7.t:0 "False Beliefs"
 devotion_events.7.d:0 "One of [Root.GovernmentName]'s purposes is to spread the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith and protect it from heresy. It is a noble cause, but when heresy strikes in the very heart of our country it shames us. One of our provinces does not follow the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith and as our cause is to spread the true faith we must deal with this or be forever shamed."
 devotion_events.7.a:0 "Send missionaries and increase efforts to convert the heretics."
 devotion_events.7.b:0 "Then we shall be ashamed."
 devotion_events.8.t:0 "Forgery of Documents"
 devotion_events.8.d:0 "It was a common defense against annexation and usurpation to forge documents, have them counterfeited or backdated to corroborate one's arguments during times of struggles for expansion of land or privileges. Even now these questionable methods are used, and even we ponder if this practice should benefit us. Hopefully no one will detect the discrepancies..."
 devotion_events.8.a:0 "Forge those documents."
 devotion_events.8.b:0 "Keep that filth out of our archives!"
 devotion_events.8.ct:0 "The forgery might be discovered..."
 devotion_events.9.t:0 "Forged Documents"
 devotion_events.9.d:0 "Despite our best efforts in concealing the forgery, the counterfeit, the backdated documents, we were exposed. All we wanted to do was to protect [Root.Country.GetName] from those who would seek to annex and usurp our provinces."

 devotion_events.10.t:0 "The Local Noble"
 devotion_events.10.d:0 "[Root.Heir.GetName] quickly gained the trust and favor of the people of [Root.Country.GetName], especially the local aristocrats who [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] belonged to before becoming the heir to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].

 devotion_events.11.t:0 "The Foreign Noble"

 devotion_events.12.t:0 "The Merchant's Son"
 devotion_events.12.d:0 "A shrewd mind for negotiations and a talent for bargaining that must come from [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] merchant parents have made burghers, free peasants and the nobles of [Root.Country.GetName] respect and fear [Root.Heir.GetName]. They will never attempt to fool [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] in any kinds of bargains or negotiations when [Root.Heir.GetName] becomes [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 devotion_events.12.a:0 "Our heir might be a mere merchant's son, but [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] has proven [Root.Heir.GetHerselfHimself]!"

 devotion_events.13.d:0 "Learned in the science of things divine, the next [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Heir.GetName] is able to use various forms of analysis and argument to help understand, explain, defend or promote numerous religious topics."
 devotion_events.13.a:0 "We knew from the beginning that [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] will rule [Root.Country.GetName] wisely."
 devotion_events.14.t:0 "The Local Preacher"
 devotion_events.14.d:0 "The people rejoiced when the local preacher [Root.Heir.GetName] was chosen as the heir to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] of [Root.Country.GetName]. Were they rejoicing because they saw an end to [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] constant sermons, or because they believed in [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] being able to make a difference in [Root.Country.GetName]? No matter what, the people support and trust the next [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], [Root.Heir.GetName]."
 devotion_events.14.a:0 "[Root.Heir.GetName] had the people's support, now [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] has ours."
 devotion_events.15.t:0 "Rule Challenged"
 devotion_events.15.d:0 "It began, as it always does, with rumors, gossip and sneaked glances filled with contempt and malice. If this challenge to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s rule goes too far, that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] was not elected properly to the seat of [Root.Country.GetName], people will no longer speak but might try to depose [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]!"
 devotion_events.15.a:0 "How did this happen?"
 devotion_events.16.t:0 "Banned Pilgrimages and Superstitious Practices"
 devotion_events.16.d:0 "The strict, dictatorial attitude of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has provoked the peasants and burghers of [Root.Country.GetName] who demand that the ban on pilgrimages and superstitious practices is lifted. The rage exuded from these simpletons about bans that will in time be beneficial to all is not something to be tampered with."

 devotion_events.16.b:0 "The decision stands, and you'll thank us for it later!"
 devotion_events.17.t:0 "The Great Feud of [Root.GetName]"
 devotion_events.17.d:0 "The serious conflict with the city of [Root.GetCapitalName] has gone too far! The citizens have taken some of the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle]'s vassals prisoner, and despite our best efforts - countering this with anathema and interdict - the city prevails! They have started to strengthen the city's fortifications and will fight any who tries to take the city. We have tried ordering the city to revert the city wall to its previous size, but they refuse."
 devotion_events.17.a:0 "Keep at it, they will relent sooner or later."
 devotion_events.17.b:0 "Give them what they want..."

 devotion_events.18.d:0 "He claims to be a seer who has seen the civic glory, the destruction of secular art and culture and the great flood that will cleanse [Root.Capital.GetName] from its filth. The mad preacher calls for [Root.Religion.GetName] renewal and has instituted an extreme puritanical campaign. Enlisting the help of [Root.Capital.GetName]'s young men, there is a risk that he will cause disturbances or even dispute [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s right to rule!"

The encouragement by [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName]'s advisors made the guilds revolt against the aristocrats and they have opened the city gate to allow [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName]'s army to occupy the city.

Error catches them unaware, deficiencies overcome them, evil deeds and sins are committed by them intentionally and by mistake. So grant them your pardon and your forgiveness to the same extent that you hope God will grant you His pardon and His forgiveness. For you are above them, and he who appointed you is above you, and God is above him who appointed you.

Ghalib al-Ansari al-Sharrat whose works of legal theory, jurisprudence as well as mysticism show her great knowledge of Islamic sciences, are all great examples of what happens when you educate women.

Each has presented their ideas, and we are to choose between two of these. The first one: exclude state officials, such as diplomats and governors, from entering into any business. This to let them fully concentrate on their work and not on anything else, thus hopefully allowing them to do a better job. The second reform: distribute pasture lands and game reserves that now are reserved for the family of the dignitaries among the poor, to cultivate the land. Unpaid labor should also be made illegal."

Not only that, but the other guilty culprit is none other than our advisor [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName]. The trust we put in [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHim] was obviously unfounded.

Even the commoners in the streets have the nerves to make lewd jokes about ‘the friendly [Root.Consort.GetTitle] [Root.Consort.GetName]’ and ‘the bastard of [Root.Capital.GetName]’. They say that the Queen is an adulteress and that [Root.Heir.GetName], the heir of [Root.GetName], is not actually the [Root.Heir.GetDaughterSon] of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]. All we can do at this point is keeping up appearances as best we can and hope that the rumors will die down in time."
