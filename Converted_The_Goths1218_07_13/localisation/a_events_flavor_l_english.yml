#Thirty Year War Events
 tyw_events.1.t:0 "Reservatum Ecclesiasticum"
 tyw_events.1.d:0 "As Emperor, we may have to accept that some of our subjects fall to heresy to avoid internal conflict. The ruler dictates the religion of the realm, after all. We may not afford to be so lenient with ecclesiastical principalities, however. One of the Prince-Bishops who rule in the Holy Roman Empire appears to have abandoned the Church and listened to the lies of the Protestants, risking not only his own soul, but those of all his subjects. Thanks to the ecclesiastical reservation, we reserve the right to force him to resign in the event of betrayal like this."
 tyw_events.1.a:0 "Enforce it! A good Catholic will take his place."
 tyw_events.1.a.tt:0 "Send word to the [This.Monarch.GetTitle] of [This.GetName]. We will know his response in two weeks' time."
 tyw_events.1.b:0 "It would cause too much trouble."
 tyw_events.2.t:0 "Emperor Demands Resignation"
 tyw_events.2.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName]'s conversion to the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith appears to have angered Emperor [From.Monarch.GetName]. [From.GetName] is now claiming to enforce the Reservatum Ecclesiasticum, a measure that forces [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]s within the Empire to give up their titles if they convert from Catholicism. The reservation is not supported among Protestants in the Empire, and perhaps it would lose some of its authority if genuinely contested."
 tyw_events.2.a:0 "It's in the Emperor's right."
 tyw_events.2.b:0 "Never! There is salvation outside the Church!"
 tyw_events.3.t:0 "[From.Monarch.GetTitle] Refuses Resignation"
 tyw_events.3.d:0 "To our surprise and outrage, [From.Monarch.GetName] of [From.GetName] has refused to accept the validity of the ecclesiastical reservation as we interpret it, claiming that evoking it is proof of tyranny on our part. If we wish to save the souls of the [From.GetAdjective] people, it appears we have to enforce the true faith ourselves."
 tyw_events.3.a:0 "The heretics will burn."
 tyw_events.4.t:0 "[From.Monarch.GetTitle] Resigns"
 tyw_events.4.d:0 "The [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of [From.GetName] has wisely accepted our enforcement of the ecclesiastical reservation and resigned in favor of the Catholic [From.Monarch.GetName]. We have also demonstrated that the Holy Roman Empire stays true to its name and that we expect our religious leaders, if not all princes, remain on the true path or give their title to one who does."
 tyw_events.4.a:0 "The Emperor protects."
 tyw_events.5.t:0 "Blockade"
 tyw_events.5.d:0 "The people of [Root.GetCapitalName] rely heavily on their port to supply the city with what it needs, but the blockade against [Root.GetName] has cut off both many luxuries and some goods they claim are necessary to run the city. The people can hardly make do with [Root.GetTradeGoodsName] alone, and are turning to the [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] to find a solution."
 tyw_events.5.a:0 "Divert resources to get goods delivered via land routes."
 tyw_events.5.b:0 "Employ our network of privateers to smuggle the goods in."
 tyw_events.5.c:0 "War is hard on everyone. They will have to make do."
 tyw_events.6.t:0 "The Great Comet"
 tyw_events.6.d:0 "Mysterious phenomena on the night sky have often been interpreted as bad omens or signs of the end times. An exceptionally noticeable such phenomenon, a great comet, has been visible recently, causing more of a stir than usual.\n\n$NATURAL_SCIENTIST$, however, has taken the opportunity to closely observe the comet's movements. The result has been a scientific work that tells us much about the object's distance from us and dispels many old superstitions about comets. While it appears uncertain if commoners will remember this in the future, this comet has provided more insight than fear."
 tyw_events.6.a:0 "Keep looking at the sky!"
 tyw_events.7.t:0 "Education for a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 tyw_events.7.d:0 "The tragic passing of the previous [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has left [Root.Heir.GetName] without a parent, but not without guardians or tutors. Advisors serving at our court are preoccupied with giving [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] the best education available in preparation of ruling [Root.GetName]. Hoping to gain favor and influence in the future, many people try to serve as a primary influence. Ultimately, one of them is likely to succeed, impacting what sort of ruler [Root.Heir.GetName] will turn out to be."
 tyw_events.7.a:0 "An advisor working in the administrative division will provide the best education."
 tyw_events.7.a.tt:0 "[Root.Heir.GetName] will increase [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] administrative skills."
 tyw_events.7.b:0 "A diplomatic mind is necessary to teach and to rule [Root.GetName]."
 tyw_events.7.b.tt:0 "[Root.Heir.GetName] will increase [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] diplomatic skills."
 tyw_events.7.c:0 "Warfare must be the primary concern of a future [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 tyw_events.7.c.tt:0 "[Root.Heir.GetName] will increase [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] military skills."
 tyw_events.8.t:0 "Scottish Mercenaries"
 tyw_events.8.d:0 "Although Scotland has so far managed to stay out of the religious conflicts in the Holy Roman Empire, it is not for lack of interest. We are keenly aware that this war will impact all of Europe and are not without diplomatic stake in the outcome. Although Scotland may not be willing to go to war for a League, many Scots are. Serving as mercenaries in foreign armies on the continent, they may well change the course of the war without our direct involvement."
 tyw_events.8.a:0 "Send them to fight for the Evangelical League."
 tyw_events.8.b:0 "Send them to fight for the Catholic League."
 tyw_events.8.c:0 "We need all the troops we can muster right here."
 tyw_events.9.t:0 "Scottish Mercenaries"
 tyw_events.9.d:0 "Mercenaries from Scotland have begun to join our ranks in large numbers. Reports indicate that our allies are also seeing many of them arriving to join the righteous in our efforts to finish the religious struggles in the Holy Roman Empire once and for all. Although their nation is not joining us in the war, the Scots appear to be willing to fight for our League, for the right price."
 tyw_events.9.a:0 "Then we shall be willing to pay it."
 tyw_events.10.t:0 "Hungarians Revolt Against Habsburg Rule"
 tyw_events.10.d:0 "The Hungarian people of [Root.GetName] have begun to see the religious conflict in the Empire as one between them and the Habsburgs who rule [Root.Owner.GetName]. When war rages between Protestant and Catholic kings and emperors, they claim that the people must take up arms to protect their faith as well. As if the ongoing war was not enough, we must now grapple with these troublemakers in lands that should long since have accepted being ruled by the Habsburg dynasty."
 tyw_events.10.a:0 "Our enemies spread lies everywhere."
 tyw_events.11.t:0 "Huguenots Gather in La Rochelle"
 tyw_events.11.d:0 "The wars of religion may be over, but the religious conflicts in France are not. The Huguenot heretics, claiming to be concerned about their right to practice their faith under the rule of [Root.Monarch.GetName], have started to prepare for what might very well be open revolt. Although they have not gone that far yet, they have gathered in the city of La Rochelle and started to fortify its defensive structures. Their exact intentions are not clear, but the more rebellious among them claim that they will create an independent state, breaking free from French and Catholic rule."
 tyw_events.11.a:0 "If this continues, we may just turn out to be as ruthless as they claim us to be."
 tyw_events.12.t:0 "Huguenot Rebels Need Our Help"
 tyw_events.12.d:0 "Although [Root.GetName] is now free from the tyranny of the Catholic Church, many suffer the same oppression abroad. The Huguenots in France have found it necessary to build fortifications in preparation of the terrors the French regime no doubt are willing to visit upon them.\n\nAs true as the faith of these brave people might be, it is doubtful if they have the means to resist the power of the French army. However, with the backing of the [Root.GetAdjective] [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], anything is possible."
 tyw_events.12.a:0 "Tell them to strike against the French, and we will follow!"
 tyw_events.12.b:0 "We would rather not draw the wrath of France."
 tyw_events.13.t:0 "British Support for Huguenots"
 tyw_events.13.d:0 "The Huguenot dissidents who gathered in La Rochelle, previously showing at least some caution, have been emboldened by the support of the [From.GetAdjective] [From.Monarch.GetTitle]. Apparently the treacherous heretics in [From.GetName] have seen it fit not only to spread their lies to France, but to spark fires here as well. Whether or not they will honor their promise, the Huguenots are now in open revolt."
 tyw_events.13.a:0 "Enemies of France will pay for this, in La Rochelle as well as in [From.Capital.GetCapitalName]."
 tyw_events.14.t:0 "Fall of Prague"
 tyw_events.14.d:0 "Prague has been home to many kings and even emperors and is a city with many legacies within it. With today's capture by [Root.GetAdjective] troops, there is certainly a temptation to bring some of the city's treasures back to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] and claim them for our own. With some rare artifacts being peerless in the known world, this may be our only chance to get our hands on them... but hardly without drawing the anger of Prague's citizens."
 tyw_events.14.a:0 "Bring these to our capital! That is how legacies are built."
 tyw_events.14.b:0 "These treasures belong here."
 tyw_events.15.t:0 "Albrecht von Wallenstein"
 tyw_events.15.d:0 "A noble of the House of Waldstein has emerged as a talented general amidst the religious conflicts in the Holy Roman Empire. Hailing from Bohemia, Wallenstein proved his loyalty to the emperor early in the war. He has already begun to provide insights and innovation both on the larger and smaller scale of warfare and will, we hope, continue to be a valuable asset in our efforts to restore faith and order to the Empire."
 tyw_events.15.a:0 "Emperor [Root.Monarch.GetName] needs loyalty now more than ever."
 tyw_events.16.t:0 "Wallenstein's Loyalties Doubted"
 tyw_events.16.d:0 "Since joining our forces early in the war, Wallenstein has shown himself to be very capable as a military commander. However, although he has made an effort to appear loyal and grateful, he is known to disagree with many of Emperor [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s decisions. Reliable sources indicate that he has even been angered by some of our refusals to compromise in the conflict. Many now suspect him of considering defecting to the enemy. Fortunately, some of the officers in his forces are still loyal to us first. They could ensure he never fights for another League."
 tyw_events.16.a:0 "He needs to be captured, alive or dead."
 tyw_events.16.b:0 "We need him alive, leading out troops."
 tyw_events.17.t:0 "Wallenstein Betrays Us"
 tyw_events.17.d:0 "The worst fears of our advisors have proven true. Our dependence on Wallenstein's military leadership while the war put increased strain on our nation and Empire made him bold enough to desert us in the midst of the war, fleeing to join the enemy. Our troops have not seen the last of him on the battlefields, but he will now be leading the armies of the traitors against the Emperor."
 tyw_events.17.a:0 "We should have had him killed while we had the chance."
 tyw_events.17.a.tt:0 "Albrecht von Wallenstein will defect to [This.GetName]."
 tyw_events.18.t:0 "General Wallenstein Defects from [From.GetName]"
 tyw_events.18.d:0 "Our war to stop the [From.Religion.GetName] tyranny of the Holy Roman Emperor in [From.Capital.GetCapitalName] has made even [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] own generals doubt their cause. After seeing [From.GetName]'s refusal to compromise as the war drags on, Albrecht von Wallenstein has decided that he would be better off serving us. It appears they doubted his loyalties one time too many."
 tyw_events.18.a:0 "A self-fulfilling prophecy, but fortunate for us."
 tyw_events.19.t:0 "Winter Siege"
 tyw_events.19.d:0 "A siege dragging on over winter is always costly and best avoided completely. This winter has been particularly harsh and one of our sieges has seen both equipment and soldiers freezing. At this rate, we'll either have to recuperate and wait out the winter or send in more men, many of whom are likely to die from cold and starvation. How many are we willing to sacrifice to take this one city?"
 tyw_events.19.a:0 "As many as it takes."
 tyw_events.19.b:0 "Let us bide our time."
 tyw_events.20.t:0 "End of the House of Griffins"
 tyw_events.20.d:0 "The tumultuous state of the Holy Roman Empire has taken a toll on our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s health. Our small nation lies in the midst of a brewing conflict, and at the worst possible time, our ruler is in poor health and lacks heirs. With [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] passing, Pomerania sees the end of the Griffins, who have ruled this nation for centuries, and risks partition by the powers who are opportunistically striking against the weakest parts of the Empire."
 tyw_events.20.a:0 "We will persist as sovereign through these hard times."
 tyw_events.20.a.tt:0 "[This.GetName] will gain claims on all Pomeranian provinces."
 tyw_events.21.t:0 "End of the House of Griffins"
 tyw_events.21.d:0 "After ruling Pomerania for centuries, the last [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of the House of Griffins to reign in the country has passed away without an heir. With the ongoing religious conflicts in the Holy Roman Empire, it would not be impossible for someone with ambition to lay claim to the region. However, we are not the only ones who have noticed this, and many powers may soon prepare to get their share to Pomeranian lands."
 tyw_events.21.a:0 "We know an opportunity when we see one."
 tyw_events.22.t:0 "Battle of [Root.GetCapitalName]"
 tyw_events.22.d:0 "The League war has been brought to the heart of our nation, and yet we have suffered defeat. [From.GetAdjective] forces engaged ours near our capital of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] and won, which has caused both concern and shame in our military. The war may be won yet, but this battle may still be remembered, whether we like it or not."
 tyw_events.22.a:0 "We can only hope our future successes will overshadow it."
 tyw_events.23.t:0 "Enemies of the League"
 tyw_events.23.d:0 "Our decision to take a stance in the religious conflict in the Holy Roman Empire has caused even more heated discussions about where [Root.GetName] stands on the issue of the Reformation. We may not doubt the goals of the League, but there is no shortage of people in our country who do. What is obvious to us, that we have chosen the right side for the good of all [Root.GetAdjective] people regardless of faith, seems like the lies of heretics to some of our subjects. The most zealous objectors have taken up arms against their rulers and the League."
 tyw_events.23.a:0 "How little these people know of international affairs."
 tyw_events.24.t:0 "$THEOLOGIAN$$INQUISITOR$ Questions Our Faith"
 tyw_events.24.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName] is a practically minded ruler. Although as pious as any [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], politically expedient alliances come first, and despite our [Root.Religion.GetName] faith, we have joined a religious League that opposes our beliefs. Most advisors see this as a necessity - some of them may even have suggested it.\n\n$THEOLOGIAN$$INQUISITOR$ is not such an advisor. A person of faith, they have hid their outrage at our decision poorly and their attitude is now beginning to impact our international diplomacy. Although we remain loyal to the League, we may find it difficult to retain good relations with its members when we are not only of the wrong faith, but keep such company."
 tyw_events.24.a:0 "If they can't keep their mouth shut, they must go."
 tyw_events.24.b:0 "Our allies deserve to hear the truth, even when they don't like it."
 tyw_events.25.t:0 "[Root.Religion.GetName] [Root.Culture.GetName] Question our Rule"
 tyw_events.25.d:0 "The people of [Root.GetName] have often seen their loyalty to [Root.Owner.GetName] questioned both because of their [Root.Culture.GetName] heritage and because of their refusal to follow the [Root.Owner.Religion.GetName] faith. This has led some of them to question whether they belong under the rule of [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] at all. Increasingly, they are requesting the right for locals who represent their interests to make decisions on how the province should be ruled. We are reaching a point where some kind of compromise has to be made."
 tyw_events.25.a:0 "Give power to the [Root.Religion.GetName] [Root.Owner.Culture.GetName] nobles in the region."
 tyw_events.25.b:0 "Give power to those [Root.Culture.GetName] who follow the [Root.Owner.Religion.GetName] faith."
 tyw_events.25.c:0 "Agree to give them the right to rule themselves to some extent."
 tyw_events.26.t:0 "Jesuit Education for [Root.Heir.GetName]"
 tyw_events.26.d:0 "The Society of Jesus, a congregation more commonly known as by the name of its members, the Jesuits, have offered to provide an education for young [Root.Heir.GetName]. Many relatives and advisors have supported the suggestion, hoping that [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] will grow up to become, as the Jesuits call themselves, a soldier of God. In these turbulent times, they argue, strength of the spirit is the most important trait of a ruler. Others fear that a people so close to the Church would harden the nascent [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s heart to those who stray from its doctrine."
 tyw_events.26.a:0 "We need a [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] who can fight for our faith!"
 tyw_events.26.a.tt:0 "[Root.Heir.GetName] will be raised as a soldier of God, versed in military matters, but harsh on heretics."
 tyw_events.26.b:0 "We will not allow a religious order to influence our future ruler."
 tyw_events.27.t:0 "Jesuit-Educated [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] Ascends to the Throne"
 tyw_events.27.d:0 "Leaving [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s education to the Jesuits has yielded what most would consider the expected results. The new [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] does not lack conviction or bravery, but is fiercely loyal to the Catholic Church and the Jesuits in particular. The faithful rejoice, but heretics now fear [Root.GetName] more than ever."
 tyw_events.27.a:0 "Ad maiorem Dei gloriam."
 tyw_events.28.t:0 "[Root.Culture.GetName] Nobles Flee Abroad"
 tyw_events.28.d:0 "The war for religious unity in the Holy Roman Empire is not going our way. Our capital of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], by many considered the last safe refuge for those who can make it there, has been taken by the enemy. Now the nobility, both those who resided in the city to begin with and those who fled there, fear that [Root.GetName] is lost and have started to escape to those neighbors who may still house good [Root.Religion.GetName]s."
 tyw_events.28.a:0 "Let them flee, and return when [Root.GetName] sees better days."
 tyw_events.28.b:0 "Bring them to safety within our borders, whatever it takes."
 tyw_events.29.t:0 "[From.Culture.GetName] Nobles Seek Refuge"
 tyw_events.29.d:0 "The occupation of [From.Capital.GetCapitalName] has frightened many among [From.GetName]'s nobility, causing them to flee the country and hoping to find shelter among their fellow [Root.Religion.GetName]s here. Since the conflict is religious, at least on the surface, we would be expected to aid those who share our faith. Yet the eyes of the League's enemies are ever upon us, and there are many who would not take kindly to seeing their enemies under our protection."
 tyw_events.29.a:0 "Surely there are others who can carry this burden."
 tyw_events.29.b:0 "[Root.Religion.GetName] faithful will always find a haven here."
 tyw_events.30.t:0 "Íñigo Vélez de Guevara"
 tyw_events.30.d:0 "Conflicts like our present concerns over the religious state of the Holy Roman Empire, although they may seem decided by war, also require diplomatic tact and shrewdness to be won. We happen to have a man at our disposal, the Count of Oñate, who possesses these exact talents. Our enemies in the Empire have neighbors who may very well be interested in knowing that we'd rather see that land in other hands. Merely letting them know could spark a conflict to our advantage."
 tyw_events.30.a:0 "Send news that [Root.GetName] wish to give them the lands of our enemies."
 tyw_events.30.a.tt:0 "Offer [This.GetName] a claim on a neighboring HRE nation who opposes on in the Leagues."
 tyw_events.30.b:0 "His talents are better applied to long-term diplomatic efforts."
 tyw_events.31.t:0 "[From.GetName] Offers League Enemy"
 tyw_events.31.d:0 "The allegiance of one of our neighbors, a fellow member of the Empire, appears to have angered [From.GetName]. They have sent an ambassador, a man named Íñigo Vélez de Guevara who appears to have conducted diplomacy in various parts of the Empire, to offer us a claim on the lands of those who have opposed their League.\n\nDire times may be ahead, but dire times are not without opportunities. This is a chance to expand our borders, or alternately to show that we mean our neighbors in the Empire no harm, regardless of League loyalties."
 tyw_events.31.a:0 "Accept the ambassador's offer."
 tyw_events.31.b:0 "Let all know that we do not lay claim to this land."
 tyw_events.32.t:0 "Enforce Sound Toll for Sweden"
 tyw_events.32.d:0 "The Sound Toll has been an important source of income for Denmark since the early 15th century and has allowed us to wield significant influence over the trade through Øresund since.\n\nSweden has been exempt from the tolls since our countries were united in the Kalmar Union. However, Sweden is no longer under the rule of the Danish crown and has not been for a long time. Perhaps they should start paying the price as well - there is only so much generosity we can show for old time's sake, after all."
 tyw_events.32.a:0 "We should have removed that exemption long ago."
 tyw_events.32.b:0 "Traditions like these are what keeps the peace."
 tyw_events.33.t:0 "Denmark Enforces Sound Toll"
 tyw_events.33.d:0 "Despite their control of the Sound already giving them a powerful position in Baltic trade, the Danes appear to have let their greed get the better of them. We have been informed that the Sound Toll, which our nation has been exempt from since the days of the Kalmar Union, is now enforced for Swedish ships as well. This is already looking to be a significant annoyance, and some advisors are even suggesting plans for going to war over this grave insult."
 tyw_events.33.a:0 "Danish devils!"
 tyw_events.34.t:0 "Request Ottoman Backing to Claim Poland"
 tyw_events.34.d:0 "We live in a time of possibilities, and our nation has only begun to expand its borders. Born at the edge between the Christian and the Muslim world, with both the Holy Roman Empire and the Ottoman Empire so close, we must use our connections wisely to persist. Having maintained good diplomatic relations with the Turks, we can leverage their support to prepare an invasion of the Polish lands and claim them for our own."
 tyw_events.34.a:0 "The time is right. This is our chance."
 tyw_events.34.a.tt:0 "If the Ottomans agree, we should have claims on neighboring Polish provinces after a week."
 tyw_events.34.b:0 "Transylvania wishes no harm to the Poles."
 tyw_events.35.t:0 "Transylvania Requests Backing to Claim Poland"
 tyw_events.35.d:0 "[From.Monarch.GetName] of Transylvania has sent word that they considering an invasion of Poland. Believing that we'd benefit from seeing their neighbors weakened, they want our implicit support for claiming this land."
 tyw_events.35.a:0 "An excellent initiative."
 tyw_events.35.b:0 "We see no point in such a campaign."
 tyw_events.36.t:0 "Free Hungary from Religious Oppression"
 tyw_events.36.d:0 "The formation of the Leagues in the Holy Roman Empire have made it clear that we live in a time when nations no longer sit idly by and allow people of their faith to suffer under godless rulers. Not far from our border, Hungarian [Root.Religion.GetName]s are in exactly that unacceptable situation. Our nation has strong bonds with Hungary in law and in spirit, and cannot let this continue. It is time for us to free them and reclaim the land, so that [Root.Religion.GetName] blood may never be spilled upon it again."
 tyw_events.36.a:0 "Transylvania stands with the Hungarians."
 tyw_events.37.t:0 "Golden Age of Transylvania"
 tyw_events.37.d:0 "Our nation is seeing perhaps its best era since it was born into its current form. [Root.Monarch.GetName] has proven to be a highly capable [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], and investments are being made to make [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] a cultured and impressive city. We hope to spread architecture and education throughout the nation over the coming decade, and pray that this age of peace and prosperity will last."
 tyw_events.37.a:0 "We will build a nation to last throughout the ages."
 tyw_events.38.t:0 "United in Prayer"
 tyw_events.38.d:0 "[Root.Monarch.GetName], being a [Root.Monarch.GetWomanMan] of faith, has found an unusually personal way of creating trust and ensuring loyalty. When meeting another [Root.Religion.GetName] ruler in person, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] will often ask them to pray together for their common goals. While perhaps forsaking some of the distance sometimes needed in diplomacy, it can create stronger bonds than any formal agreement. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] has considered employing this method again on an upcoming visit to a foreign capital, although it is not certain if it will be successful."
 tyw_events.38.a:0 "Souls, not only minds, must unite for true trust to be formed."
 tyw_events.38.b:0 "Perhaps it would be better to practice more secular diplomacy."
 tyw_events.39.t:0 "God is Spanish"
 tyw_events.39.d:0 "Our ongoing war over the religious state of the Holy Roman Empire is going well. The optimism from seeing our efforts to accomplish religious goals has taken on an especially spiritual form, with one of our minister declaring that God is Spanish, fighting for our nation these days. If things continue to go our way, even our enemies may have to admit that there is some truth to this."
 tyw_events.39.a:0 "What better ally could a soldier ever ask for?"
 tyw_events.40.t:0 "God Wants Peace"
 tyw_events.40.d:0 "Our ongoing war over the religious state of the Holy Roman Empire is going poorly. Since religion is at the core of this conflict, many of those who once claimed that God was with us when we decided to join the League are now claiming that God is depriving us of the means of war and wants us to make peace. Although far from the only interpretation of current events, it has been echoed enough times to increase the doubts that the war can be won."
 tyw_events.40.a:0 "'Tis a poor faith that increases doubt."
 tyw_events.41.t:0 "Bartering Increases"
 tyw_events.41.d:0 "While the poor state of the [Root.GetAdjective] currency is becoming ever more troubling for us, the common people have started to look to other solutions. Many are growing wary of the use of money and avoid it whenever possible, reverting to old means of trade like the barter system. Perhaps their concerns are misplaced, but if we do not act swiftly, we may lose our grip on the economy and the country itself."
 tyw_events.41.a:0 "Let us just hope this works well for them until we get the problem under control."
 tyw_events.41.b:0 "Seek the advice of our best economists to stop this by any means."
 tyw_events.42.t:0 "Capturing the Spanish Treasure Fleet"
 tyw_events.42.d:0 "Our privateers have long been an annoyance to the Spanish fleets, but a daring plan hatched recently would make us more than just an annoyance. The Spanish Treasure Fleet is departing from the colonies, carrying a cargo of silver, gold and exotic goods worth more than their weight in either. Our privateers plan to intercept these ships in the early stages of their route. They assure us that the cargo can be captured with little risk, and is unlikely to fail unless someone betrays our plan to the Spanish."
 tyw_events.42.a:0 "Their treasures are better off in [Root.GetAdjective] hands."
 tyw_events.42.b:0 "We hardly wish to draw the wrath of the Spanish armada."
 tyw_events.43.t:0 "Spanish Treasure Fleet Captured!"
 tyw_events.43.d:0 "One by one, the ships of the Spanish Treasure Fleet were intercepted, many of them taken by surprise, some of them trapped, unprepared for us to make such a bold attack. Despite some ships receiving warning beforehand, the cargo from the captured ships will boost our economy for months, if not years. The privateers have returned to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] as heroes. We are unlikely to ever see such a successful capture again."
 tyw_events.43.a:0 "Yet it was a joy to see it once."
 tyw_events.44.t:0 "Treasure Fleet Captured by the Dutch"
 tyw_events.44.d:0 "The Dutch privateers who have long plagued our efforts to get trade goods home from distant colonies recently made a direct attack on our Treasure Fleet just as it was leaving for the Spanish ports to bring silver and gold back to our homeland. Although some ships were prepared and managed to avoid the assault, the ones who did not cost us dearly. It has not yet been decided how or what the Dutch will pay for this, but they will certainly pay."

The attempt was carried out by seven royalists who had connections to the earlier Chouan Revolt. A bomb hidden in a barrel loaded on a parked cart exploded just as Napoleon and his escort were passing by on the way to the Opéra to see the opening of Joseph Haydn's oratorio 'Die Schöpfung.' The bomb, nicknamed the 'Infernal Machine', was filled with gunpowder, flammable materials and bullets, and set off by using a long fuse. The explosion killed several bystanders but failed to hurt Napoleon."

Mutinous troops of our enemy desired the sack and pillage of our rich city that for them appeared to be an easy target. The troops were joined by deserters and numerous bandits and their number soon greatly outnumbered ours. Our massive walls and strong artillery force at first seemed capable to repel the attackers, and when their commander was fatally wounded in the first assault we thought they would retreat, but no. Their restraint disappeared when their commander fell, and the soldiers captured the walls of Rome the same day. On the steps of St Peter's Basilica, our last few guards met a ghastly end, slaughtered before the pillage began. Destruction, looting and executions followed until, at last, the bandits, deserters, soldiers and looters began their long trek home with what valuables they managed to pilfer."

Granted that earlier Popes have allowed this, as they argued that these new people were not truly human and possessed no souls. The New Testament says that the gospel has been preached to all nations and since they do not believe in our God, perhaps they do not count. Humanity is divided into three race, Europeans, Asians, and Africans, one for each of the sons of Noah, and the Indians of the Americas do not fit among these divisions. Now that we know that these pagans can be converted, it is time to revision our old beliefs and acknowledge these as humans, with souls, who God has a purpose for."

Over the years it has grown from a major pilgrimage to one of the great temple cities in India. The city is supported by the donations of countless treasures as well as over 40 villages providing it with food and income.\nWe should however not be content with this. By increasing our support, providing it with even more villages and donations, we could ensure that it becomes the greatest temple city in all of Southern India.

 #Bengal Events

 flavor_bng.1.d:0 "The Sufi Chishti order has always had a special relationship with our royal dynasty. The order has been able to rely on our patronage and we have relied on its support in return. Less than a generation ago Nur Qutb-i ‘Alam, leader of the Chishti in Bengal ensured our return to power as the Sultanate was threatened by a Hindu usurper.\nAs the sad news of Nur Qutb-i ‘Alam's passing now reach us the time has come to reaffirm this alliance between worldly and spiritual power. On the other hand this might also be a good opportunity to distance the throne from the Chishti order, an organization which has grown a bit too powerful for comfort."

 flavor_bng.2.t:0 "The Nabibangsha"
 flavor_bng.2.d:0 "In time the Sufi presence in Bengal has led to a certain degree of religious syncretism. As part of this general trend the Bengali author and poet Sayid Sultan has recently created something quite unique. It is a book in Bengali about the lineage of the prophets of Islam. One of the unusual features of this book is that among the classical row of prophets Sayid Sultan has also included the Hindu god Krishna among those that came before Mohamed."

Not content with having cleared the area in the 1430s the local ruler Khan Jahan Ali has spent a lifetime filling the city with Mosques and great buildings.

 flavor_bng.4.d:0 "Bengal is famed for its fertile soil and rich harvests. The great delta of the Ganges is however still covered by thick jungles and swamps. The clearing of land to allow our ever-growing population some room to spread is a process that has been going on slowly but steadily for longer than anyone can remember.\nRecently a number of holy men, many of them Sufis have begun to get involved in this process. These holy men have mobilized the hearts of our people and the process of land reclamation suddenly seems to be going a lot smoother than it ever has before. As if to confirm that things are now moving in the right direction the flow of the great river Ganges itself has shifted in a way that has further helped this process along."

Surely our state can benefit from their contacts and experience. At the same time their arrival is causing social tension and unrest in our lands."

As the prisoners then returned to their respective mother countries however this incident seems to have grown out of all proportion.\nAmong the freed a story has begun to circulate about a terrible dungeon known as the Black Hole of Calcutta. According to the story the vast majority of the prisoners died due to the horrible conditions they had to endure there.

 flavor_bah.1.d:0 "Tired of the constant intrigues and the poisonous atmosphere in Gulbarga one of the first decisions undertaken by $MONARCH$ in his youth was to move the capital of the Bahmani kingdom to Bidar. On the site of an old fort squarely in the middle of the Deccan plateau an entirely new capital has been built, a magnificent city comparable to the great cities of Persia and Transoxiana. With its 37 bastions and 7 gates Bidar is also an impressive fort and the foremost defense of our dynasty.\nBuilt to impress the royal court itself, it is no less awe-inspiring and the audience hall with the Turquoise throne of our dynasty is perhaps the most renowned symbol of our family.\nNone of this comes cheap of course. Our vizier contacted us today with a list of things in need of urgent attention and another list of areas which we would be wise to continue to develop."

 flavor_bah.2.d:0 "The Bahmani Sultanate is in many ways a colonial state. The Deccan had only been under Muslim control for 20 years when our ancestors threw off the imperialist yoke of Delhi. The vast majority of our subjects are Hindu Marathas, Kannadigas and Telugus.\nWith northern India closed to us by the Delhi Sultans for so long we have had to rely on oversea immigration directly from Persia and the Arab world to fill the needs of our state.\nOur dynasty has therefore always spent much energy trying to attract able and learned men to what has become a rather cosmopolitan kingdom. Since we lost control of the western coast however it seems this stream of able people has been transformed into a trickle. If we want to avert a serious crisis we must double our efforts to lure all men of quality here despite the risks."

 flavor_bah.4.d:0 "Slaves is one of the oldest commodities of the Indian Ocean trade network. Ethiopian youths are being captured, converted to Islam and trained to become elite soldiers, administrators and sailors before being sold to rulers in India and Persia.\nAs our kingdom has a distinct shortage of men that are both able and loyal these 'Habshis' might prove a valuable asset to our dynasty. Let us use these slaves to man our forts, our desks and our ships rather than trust the bickering Gharbian and Deccani factions at court."

Known as 'Deccanis', second and third generation Bahmani nobles together with the remaining part of the old Hindu nobility are increasingly becoming a strong faction at court advocating the indigenization of our Sultanate. Against them stand the new immigrants from the west, the 'Gharbians', who have come to seek a fortune in the rich lands of India.\nThe court is by now quite polarized between the two and lately they even have to be kept separated in our audience chamber and at royal ceremonies."

 flavor_mer.2.t:0 "The return of Rana Jodha Rathore"
 flavor_mer.2.d:0 "When we annexed the neighboring kingdom of Marwar in 1438 it was in an act of retribution. The Rathore Ranas of Marwar, once trusted friends and regents to our Rajas, had conspired to murder our royal heir and overthrow our kingdom. Ever since the last remaining heir of the Rathore lineage has been wandering the deserts of Rajasthan biding his time and waiting for an opportunity to reclaim his patrimony.\nThat time seems to have finally come, at least in the mind of Jodha Rathore. We have just received word that our men in the Mandore fort in Marwar have been overwhelmed by soldiers loyal to the cause of the Rathores."

In order to defend ourselves and deter any would-be invader we must fortify our kingdom. Plans have been drawn up for a fortress making use of the Aravalli range itself as a wall against our enemies. This huge mountaintop fortress would allow us to keep a close watch on most of our lands and together with Chittorgarh fort it will make our lands a nightmare to control for any invader."

The marriage was to become a quite short affair however as the young princess was widowed a few years later.\nAs a widow Mira Bai have become increasingly devoted to Krishna and has been seen wandering the streets of the capital singing and dancing with others of a similarly strong faith. The fact that this behavior is far from fitting for a royal widow has lead to some ill will within the royal family.

It is what propelled our ancestors from mere governors of the east (Malik-us-Sharq) to Sultans in their own right. Since that day we have watched with great interest as the Delhi Sultanate has gradually been torn apart by inner struggles and claimants with outside support, using every opportunity to slowly eat away at their control over northern India.\nDelhi's situation is now worse than ever and as yet another power hungry local strongman marches on the capital an increasing stream of Delhian nobles and officials pour over our borders seeking new employment and offering to help us secure what remains of the Delhian lands."

If we are willing to expand the Hindu influence in our armies however the Rajput farming communities that dot the Doab and Gangetic regions would make for an ideal source of infantry. Not only are there many of second sons that would jump at the prospect of becoming soldiers, many of these communities are said to already have mastered the use of firearms better than many of our regular soldiers."

A Sant from a poor weaver's caste in Varanasi has risen to unprecedented levels of popularity. Kabir's poems are an attack against useless dogmas, the caste system and the Hindu and Muslim clergy. For Kabir the divine is formless and over-regulated religious customs only bring us farther from it."

 flavor_jnp.4.t:0 "The Jaunpur Qila"
 flavor_jnp.4.d:0 "The site of Jaunpur on the northern bank of the Gomti river has been commanded by a fort long before the arrival of Islam in these lands. The Delhi sultans in their day further fortified the place using materials from many of the buildings of the defeated Rashtrakutas of Kannauj.\nWith the advent of our independent Sultanate in the late 14th century the fort was further strengthened and began to serve as a royal residence. Now that our state has grown into a power in its own right however it is high time that we take a new look at the state of the Jaunpur Qila."

 flavor_jnp.5.d:0 "The first of the great works of the Jaunpur sultanate after its independence was the imposing Atala Masjid mosque, a marriage of local and Muslim architecture unlike anything that can be seen elsewhere in India. The impressive facade of the mosque is quite unique and has attracted the attention of both high and low.\nAs our Sultanate has grown so has the fame of the Atala Masjid mosque and as we now stand ready to start more works of construction it is believed we should continue to develop this unique architectural style and make it more closely associated with our Sultanate."

Every day countless Indian pilgrims traverse our lands to reach not only Varanasi but many of the other holy places of Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism in the region we occupy.\nThese travelers are compelled by their religious convictions to make this journey and will attempt to reach their goal almost regardless of any hindrance we might put in their way. Our vizier has therefore suggested that we, like the Delhi sultans before us, create a specific tax on all pilgrims that would visit the holy places in our lands. In place such a tax would undoubtedly bring us a steady income, but it would not be a very popular policy among our non-Muslim subjects."

The Sadak-e-Azam is the commercial artery of Northern India and the means by which most goods and merchants arrive or leave our lands. Making the journey safer and quicker for the travelers of this road should be a top priority for our Sultanate and for any other power that the path crosses. It has been suggested that by enforcing the existing road and supplementing the existing stops of the route by a network of Serais of our own we might greatly ease the journey for many."

The Jaunpuris would take the matter into their own hands and want to conduct a punitive expedition against Kalpi.\nWhile we have also heard rumors of the state of affairs in Kalpi this is a decision to consider carefully, Kalpi is an old contested zone between Jaunpur and Malwa and it does not seem unlikely that the Jaunpuris might have bigger plans than they let on."

The close proximity of Khambat, one of the greatest ports in India and according to some the busiest port in the world ensures a constant stream of people, goods and capital.\nSuch a rapidly growing city is however hard to defend effectively, especially given its position in the middle of the Gujarat plains. Some say we ought to take a more active part in the planning of the city and not only focus on how to adorn it.

 flavor_guj.12.d:0 "Many hundred years ago a group of Zoroastrian refugees from Persia settled down in Gujarat, founding the Parsee community of Sanjan. Through the centuries this religious minority has proved resilient and has taken an active part in the development of this dynamic region.\nRecently a Parsee priest has recorded the oral historical tradition of the Parsees, from their exodus from Persia in the 10th century up to today. The resulting Qissa-i Sanjan is surely a classical example of high class Persian poetry but it is above all a story that will be treasured by the Parsees themselves for generations to come."

The recently completed Mirat-i-Sikandiri by Shaikh Sikandar ibn Muhammad Manjhu is not only an excellent example of this but also tries to incorporate all previous writings on its subject. The resulting work is a detailed chronicle over the history of the Sultanate of Gujarat from its creation up until today."

 flavor_ori.1.d:0 "The ceremonies at the great temple in Puri and the log in which Jagannath manifests himself have at times been ridiculed and mocked by foreign rulers, but in Orissa Jagannath, the 'Lord of the Universe' is undisputedly the most popular deity.\nThe support of Jagannath and his priests have also been unwavering for Raja Kapilendra the founder of our dynasty. Now the time has come for our dynasty to repay this debt, we should patronize the temple at Puri and elevate the worship of Jagannath as the primary cult in our kingdom."

 flavor_ori.2.t:0 "The Wars of Kapilendra."
 flavor_ori.2.d:0 "When Kapilendra Deva overthrew the last of the Eastern Ganga Kings in 1434 Orissa was in a sad state. Muslim incursions from the north and west as well as rivalry with other neighbors to the south had reduced the kingdom greatly. Since then Raja Kapilendra has quickly turned all of that around. In consecutive wars with Bengal, the Reddys of Andhra, the Bahmani Sultans and the Vijayanagar empire, Orissa has grown in both size and strength under his leadership.\nThis constant warfare has however taken its toll on the population of our kingdom and an unusually bad harvest season has now resulted in growing popular unrest. It has been suggested that the public mood would be improved if we temporarily lifted the traditional Salt tax and otherwise devoted our attention to the public good a bit more."
 flavor_ori.2.a:0 "We don't need the Salt tax."

To the shock of his 18 legitimate sons however the old king, guided by the voice of Jagannath, has elected to make his illegitimate son Purushottama his heir.\nAs the king draws his last breath the royal succession is far from assured as Hamvira, the favorite candidate until this date, has fled to the south where he has taken up arms against Purushottama."

 #Malacca Events
 flavor_mlc.1.t:0 "The Plot against Raja Ibrahim"
 flavor_mlc.1.d:0 "The religious balance in an as cosmopolitan state as Malacca can be a very fragile thing. In our state traders of many religions and cultures live side by side yet still keep apart to a certain extent. The biggest communities, those of the Gujaratis, Tamils, Javanese and Chinese all have their own respective obligations to the state and keeping the influence of these groups in balance is one of the most important tasks of any Malaccan monarch.\nThe ascension of Raja Ibrahim in 1444 has therefore ruffled quite a few feathers. Ibrahim was a practicing Hindu and came to be seen by many as a traditionalist aiming to roll back the influence of Islam in our country. It still came as a big surprise when the young king was found dead in his palace today. Many suspect that his prime minister, the royal Bendahara, must've had a hand in this but little can be proven."
 flavor_mlc.1.a:0 "Raja Ibrahim will not be forgotten."
 flavor_mlc.2.t:0 "Bendahara Tun Perak"
 flavor_mlc.2.d:0 "Unlike the late Raja Ibrahim (by now known as Abu Syahid Shah, the martyred king) our new ruler is a Muslim and the trader communities in our city seem to be more accepting of his rule. Nonetheless a royal Bendahara that would plot against his liege is a frightening thing and we would be wise to replace this minister or risk meeting the same fate as his last master. Our trusted advisors all point to a young and successful general as a suitable replacement. Tun Perak is said to be wise for his years but above all he is also said to be extremely loyal."

 flavor_mlc.3.b:0 "We will use our own resources to sort this out."
 flavor_mlc.4.t:0 "Islam and the Malaccan state"
 flavor_mlc.4.d:0 "Malacca has in many ways been the center of the islamization of the Malay archipelago. Our state itself has however always avoided any stern or overly orthodox varieties of Islamic law in favor of keeping it an attractive spot for traders of all nationalities. Instead tradition is relied upon to be the law of the land while orthodox Islamic laws have been reserved for special cases, often related to keeping the public order. While this has upset some of those with more delicate religious sensibilities over the years it has been good for trade and has therefore been supported the Malaccan communities.\nOver time however Muslims have become more and more dominant in our state and due to its importance for the spread of Islam among the islands some have even begun to consider Malacca a pilgrimage site. Perhaps the time has come to introduce a bit more orthodoxy in the laws and customs of our state?"
 flavor_mlc.4.a:0 "Yes, in the name of Allah."
 flavor_mlc.4.b:0 "No, let us keep with our old traditions."
 flavor_mlc.5.t:0 "Customs and Duties"
 flavor_mlc.5.d:0 "Trade is the sole occupation for our kingdom and to the surprise of many visitors we have little in the way of agriculture and have to import even basic foodstuffs. Despite this our kingdom is flourishing and ships from all over Asia come to our docks to sell, buy and resell all kinds of goods.\nIn order to further encourage trade the royal Bendahara has suggested that we lower customs and duties to almost nothing. This bold policy would set us apart even from other trade oriented kingdoms and would in his opinion secure our place as the greatest emporium of the East."
 flavor_mlc.5.a:0 "Malacca has nothing of its own, and has everything of the world."
 flavor_mlc.5.b:0 "We cannot afford to lower these fees."
 flavor_mlc.6.t:0 "Hang Tuah"
 flavor_mlc.6.d:0 "While putting down some disturbances related to a man running amok in the countryside our Bendahara received unexpected aid from a local warrior today. When all the Bendahara's own guards had fled this man and his friends acted quickly and valiantly to save our minister. Moved by this deep loyalty to the state the Bendahara immediately appointed the young warrior, Hang Tuah, to the post of royal commander.\nOur kingdom has now gained the service of one of its greatest champions."

 flavor_mlc.7.t:0 "Arrival of the Portuguese"
 flavor_mlc.7.d:0 "Ships from distant shores is no rare thing in Malacca yet today an unusual visitor arrived in our city. The captain presents himself as coming from a Christian kingdom far to the west known as Portugal and wants to sign a trade agreement by which his country would become one of the most favored trading partners of our state.\nThe Muslim Gujarati community however is propagating very strongly that the man is dangerous and that his country is a sworn enemy to our religion. The Gujaratis are so vehemently opposed to Portuguese presence here that they have already begun to act with open hostility towards the newcomers, confiscating their goods and boarding their ships. There is a risk that this could get out of hand very quickly..."
 flavor_mlc.7.a:0 "Lambaste the Gujaratis and attempt to save the situation."

 flavor_per.13.d:0 "For too long Persia has stood divided when foreign invaders have entered our lands. While $MONARCH$ is an immensely popular $MONARCHTITLE$ a durable state should not be built on personal loyalties alone. The road forward must be to unify our people through a common religious identity different from that of our neighbors.\nWhile far from all of our subjects would identify as Shia currently there are many cases of Shiite customs, such as the honoring of the Imams, being practiced by the Muslims of Persia. By ensuring that our people all adhere to Twelver Shiism we can create a Persian identity which will stand the test of time."

With the birth of our kingdom an increasing number of Shiite theologians, clerics and all kinds of Shiite intelligentsia have come flocking to our borders from all over the Muslim world.\nThis is quite fortunate as there is a shortage of Shiite lawyers, clerics and officials in our lands, but this turn of events has made many Muslim monarchs feel quite threatened by our state."

Large numbers of Andalusian Moorish refugees have therefore been arriving in our ports, asking to be let into our country. While it pains us that these of people had to leave their homes this may well be a blessing for our kingdom. Most of the refugees are city dwellers, craftsmen, scholars, artists and administrators.

Ever since this event the Idrisid sharifs have been the centre of a growing a cult in Fez and in our kingdom in general.\nThis devout cult seems destined to lift the hearts our population after the harsh period we have left behind us.

Since twenty years past almost all power formally held by the Marinid dynasty has in fact been wielded by their formidable Wattasid vizier Abu Zakariya Yahya.\nInsanely popular after his victory over the Portuguese in 1437 and his patronization of the Idrisid cult in Fez, Abu Zakariya Yahya has ensured that the royal bureaucracy is both well functioning and imbued with Wattasid family members. As the Wattasids are related to the Marinid rulers this is in itself perhaps not a worrying development. Now that Abu Zakariya Yahya lies on his deathbed however we cannot but wonder what the future will bring.

In many ways this is a boon to our state as it has given us much easier access to horses for our armies and a way to procure valuable goods from the many exotic ports frequented by Portuguese merchants. For gold or slaves there is not much the Portuguese wouldn't sell us and our merchant caste, the Wangara, is thriving due to this new partnership.\nThere is however a slight worry about this development in some camps, the amount of slaves to a horse seem to keep increasing by the day and while our own transoceanic ventures haven't gone so well it would seem less than prudent to rely entirely on these foreign merchants as they surely can't have our best interests at heart."

While the horses they bring for our armies and the exotic goods they bring from far away countries are of great use to us it seems they cannot help but meddle in the local politics. It is clear that several chiefs that are in contact with the Portuguese have been encouraged to extend their personal authority and to slowly attempt to cut the ties with our central administration.\nIn order to deal with this we could either strike at the chiefs themselves or attempt to limit the influence of the Portuguese."

 flavor_kbo.4.b:0 "We cannot infringe upon their rights."
 flavor_kbo.5.t:0 "Calipha"
 flavor_kbo.5.d:0 "The Abbasid claimant Abd al-Azis Yakub has bestowed the title of Calipha on our $MONARCHTITLE$. This strongly legitimizing gesture is something we will make sure nobody forgets and all $MONARCH$'s successors shall use the title from now on."
 flavor_kbo.5.a:0 "Ok."
 flavor_kbo.6.t:0 "Reforms of $MONARCH$"
 flavor_kbo.6.d:0 "Inspired by what he has seen on his Hajj our $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ have decided that our kingdom must modernize its army and economy. $MONARCH$ have already begun to take steps to strengthen our cavalry arm, invite Turkish gunners and adopt the administrative techniques he has seen among our Muslims brothers between here and Mecca."
 flavor_kbo.6.a:0 "Reform both the economy and the army."
 flavor_kbo.6.b:0 "Focus on the Army."
 flavor_kbo.6.c:0 "Focus on the Economy."
 flavor_kbo.7.t:0 "Magira Aisha"
 flavor_kbo.7.d:0 "During the regency of $HEIR$ the queen mother Aisha has come to shine. Under the firm and forceful rule of this remarkable regent the kingdom itself and its future ruler are both prospering."
 flavor_kbo.7.a:0 "Ok."
 flavor_kbo.8.t:0 "Disputed Succession"

 #Fullani Events
 flavor_ful.1.t:0 "Marabout Unrest in $PROVINCENAME$"
 flavor_ful.1.d:0 "Marabout preachers inspired by the charismatic Nasir al-din have begun propagating for an Islamic reformation in $PROVINCENAME$. Many local warriors have joined with the Marabout and together they are now working outside of the state to create a society here following the Sharia in its purest form. They are violently opposed to any pagan traditions or foreign influences."
 flavor_ful.1.a:0 "Ok."
 flavor_ful.2.t:0 "Orthodox Islamic Revolution"
 flavor_ful.2.d:0 "Religious tensions have been slowly rising in our country since the rise of the Marabouts in the middle of the 17th century. Now the Marabout faction in $COUNTRYNAME$ have come out in open revolt against the old aristocracy in $CAPITAL_CITY$. The promised revolution has quickly gotten the support of many of the Fulani herdsmen that are present in large parts of our state and it is clear that we will soon have a very serious revolt on our hands."
 flavor_ful.2.a:0 "We must join the revolution, death to the aristocrats!"
 flavor_ful.2.b:0 "We must preserve our traditions!"
 flavor_ful.3.t:0 "End of the Fulani Jihad"
 flavor_ful.3.d:0 "As our country has now entirely abandoned the Islamic ideals on which it was built the Marabout faction has left our country and moved on to other places."

 #Sokoto Events
 flavor_sok.1.t:0 "Usman dan Fodio"
 flavor_sok.1.d:1 "Inspired by the Fulani religious revolutions Usman dan Fodio, a Fulani Muslim scholar in Gobir, have begun agitating for reform in our country. His strong message and his charismatic person has impressed parts of our population and a growing movement now supports the creation of a Caliphate governed by orthodox Islamic traditions, adherence to the Sharia and the mission to spread the true faith in West Africa.\nThe message is also quite critical of the current way our state is run and the authorities in Gobir fear for that Usman Dan Fodio's followers might soon openly revolt against our rule."
 flavor_sok.1.a:0 "Invite Usman dan Fodio to reform our country."
 flavor_sok.1.b:0 "This dangerous agitator and his followers must be expelled."
 flavor_sok.1.b.tt:0 "Usman dan Fodio and his followers will leave the country."
 flavor_sok.2.t:0 "The followers of Usman dan Fodio"
 flavor_sok.2.d:0 "The popular Islamic reformer Usman dan Fodio has been expelled by the authorities of Gobir. He and his followers are now looking for a pious ruler elsewhere who will allow them to reclaim the city of Gobir and create the orthodox Islamic state they dream of."
 flavor_sok.2.a:0 "Ok."
 flavor_sok.2.a.tt:0 "The Sokoto Caliphate can now be created."
 
 #Ethiopia Events
 flavor_eth.6.t:0 "Centralization reforms of Zara Yakob"
 flavor_eth.6.d:0 "Under the care of the Solomonic dynasty Ethiopia has grown from a kingdom into a great empire. However the diverse regions under our rule lack a common language, religion or administrative system.\nZara Yakob, the most able ruler Ethiopia has seen in a long time, has prepared a number of reforms that might go a long way towards creating a more unified state."
 flavor_eth.6.a:0 "We must centralize the state."
 flavor_eth.6.b:0 "We can centralize later."
 flavor_eth.7.t:0 "The Itinerant Capital"
 flavor_eth.7.d:0 "In order to control the diverse Ethiopian empire the Solomonids have never established a permanent capital. Instead the royal court travels from chief to chief every few months.\nWhile it is hard to establish an administrative continuity under such circumstances the traveling court does have its benefits. The frequent visits of the royal courts in all corners of the Empire are contributing to the growth of a common elite culture in our lands."
 flavor_eth.7.a:0 "This is how it has always been."
 flavor_eth.7.b:0 "Actively encourage the cultural conversion of the countryside."
 flavor_eth.8.t:0 "Debre Berhan - The Mountain of Light"
 flavor_eth.8.d:0 "$MONARCH$ has had a vision in which he has been shown a shining mountain on which to build the new capital of Ethiopia. A church has already been constructed at the site and now it is up to the state to realize the dream of our Emperor."
 flavor_eth.8.a:0 "The time has come for a permanent Capital."
 flavor_eth.8.b:0 "Let us not break with Tradition."
 flavor_eth.9.t:0 "Debre Berhan Plundered"
 flavor_eth.9.d:0 "Old traditions die hard and as the countryside of Debre Berhan is being plundered the new capital is being abandoned by everyone from our courtiers to the lowliest stable boy. We have no choice but to resume the custom of having an itinerant court."
 flavor_eth.9.a:0 "We must move to the provinces."
 flavor_eth.10.t:0 "Gondar - A new Capital"
 flavor_eth.10.d:0 "$MONARCH$ finds himself spending more and more time by the monasteries at lake Tana. Due to this continued patronage of the king a small market town has begun to spring up in the area and some have started to name the city as a secondary capital of our kingdom.\nThis idea has grown on $MONARCH$ who believes a permanent capital here might allow us to start a new spiritual and architectural legacy."
 flavor_eth.10.a:0 "Let us build our capital here."
 flavor_eth.10.b:0 "We must not bind ourselves to one place."
 flavor_eth.11.t:0 "The fate of the Egyptian Copts"
 flavor_eth.11.d:0 "Word has reached us from Egypt that the Mameluk sultan is persecuting the Copts in his lands. As a fellow kingdom under the Patriarchate of Alexandria it is our duty to act. The fact that the patriarch himself is in Mameluk hands complicates things somewhat however, a direct attack might place the foundation of our church at risk."
 flavor_eth.11.a:0 "Send a strongly worded letter to the Sultan."
 flavor_eth.11.b:0 "Avoid the risk of angering the Mamluks."
 flavor_eth.11.c:0 "This is cause for war!"
 flavor_eth.12.t:0 "A letter arrives from Ethiopia"
 flavor_eth.12.d:0 "We have received a letter from the Ethiopian Emperor today. The message is a detailed account of the many perceived misdeeds of our Sultanate against the Copts that reside within our borders.\nThere is likely little reason for concern however as the patriarch of both the Egyptian and Ethiopian Copts is our hostage. It seems very unlikely that an Ethiopian monarch would risk the safety of his patriarch over a matter such as this."
 flavor_eth.12.a:0 "Send a sarcastic reply."
 flavor_eth.12.b:0 "Attempt to apologize and repair relations."
 flavor_eth.13.t:0 "A letter has arrived from Ethiopia"
 flavor_eth.13.d:0 "We have received word that the Emperor of Ethiopia feels we are mistreating the Coptic population in our lands. He clearly sees this as a cause for war and there is much speculation that an Ethiopian attack might be imminent."
 flavor_eth.13.a:0 "They wouldn't dare."
 flavor_eth.14.t:0 "An ambassador from the Mameluks"
 flavor_eth.14.d:0 "Today a Mameluk messenger arrived at our court bearing the reply of the Sultan to our concerns about the Copts in his lands.\nThe reply is far from the apology we had expected however. The Sultan has chosen to show his contempt for the Ethiopian court and he ridicules any form of retribution that we might attempt."
 flavor_eth.14.a:0 "Imprison the Ambassador."
 flavor_eth.14.b:0 "This is cause for war!"
 flavor_eth.14.c:0 "Let's just drop it."
 flavor_eth.15.t:0 "Mameluks Apologize"
 flavor_eth.15.d:0 "The Mameluk Sultan has sent word that he is looking into the situation of Copts in his lands. He assures us that he has nothing but feelings of friendship towards the Ethiopian people and the Coptic church."
 flavor_eth.15.a:0 "Ok."
 flavor_eth.16.t:0 "Ambassador Detained"
 flavor_eth.16.d:0 "The Ethiopian emperor was so displeased by our reply to his letter that he had our messenger detained."
 flavor_eth.16.a:0 "Ok."
 flavor_eth.17.t:0 "Death of a Bishop"
 flavor_eth.17.d:0 "The Bishop of Ethiopia has died and the Ethiopian church has requested a successor from the Coptic Patriarch of Alexandria.\nWhile a successor has been chosen by the Patriarch this would be a good opportunity to show the Ethiopians who is in charge. The Emperor of Ethiopia has actively pursued a policy of conversion against his Muslim subjects and he still detains the ambassador we sent to chastise him last time."
 flavor_eth.17.a:0 "Prevent the appointment of a new Bishop"
 flavor_eth.17.b:0 "We must not interfere in these matters"
 flavor_eth.18.t:0 "Bishop missing"
 flavor_eth.18.d:0 "It has been a long while now since the last bishop of Ethiopia died and we requested a successor from Alexandria. Could the Mamluks be interfering?"
 flavor_eth.18.a:0 "Ok."
 flavor_eth.19.t:0 "The Monastic Orders"
 flavor_eth.19.d:0 "One of the greatest strengths of the Ethiopian church is the great number of successful monasteries that dot the landscape of our state. The Monastic orders have contributed to the success of our state by founding new monasteries in newly conquered areas and by spreading the word of the true faith there. The monasteries of Ethiopia are also the source of the education of the Ethiopian clergy, its nobility and its administrators and as such have contributed greatly to the revitalization of the Ethiopian church in the years past.\nThe other side of this coin however is that the monasteries and the orders that run them have grown both rich and autonomous."
 flavor_eth.19.a:0 "Attempt to rein them in."
 flavor_eth.19.b:0 "Safeguard the privileges of the orders"
 flavor_eth.20.t:0 "Independence from the Patriarchate"
 flavor_eth.20.d:0 "The dependency of the Ethiopian church on the Patriarchate of Alexandria has always been a liability for our country. Perhaps there was once a practical need of bishops, clergy and spiritual guidance from abroad. The expansion of the Ethiopian church over the last two centuries however means that our kingdom is now already training its own clergymen and there is a strong religious infrastructure in the form of churches and monasteries throughout or lands.\nWith the Egyptian Patriarchate held hostage by Muslim conquerors we often have to wait a long time between the death of one bishop and the appointment of the next. It would be far more efficient to appoint our religious leadership from the ranks of our own clergy."
 flavor_eth.20.a:0 "We cannot dishonor our Patriarch."
 flavor_eth.20.b:0 "Our Church should be free of foreign influence."
 flavor_eth.21.t:0 "The Oromo"
 flavor_eth.21.d:0 "A strange nomadic people have crossed our border from the African interior into our borderlands. Migrating in large numbers protected by very able warriors, their alien customs threaten to rip apart and reshape the very fabric of society here.\nThese disciples of Waaq are quickly displacing and converting the followers of the all faiths in the area, replacing old social structures with new ones of their own."
 flavor_eth.21.a:0 "Ok."
 flavor_eth.23.t:0 "Oromo Settlers"
 flavor_eth.23.d:0 "Groups of nomadic settlers have entered the province of $PROVINCENAME$. The province population is being either displaced or assimilated by the Oromo."
 flavor_eth.23.a:0 "Ok."
 flavor_eth.24.t:0 "Integration of the Oromo"
 flavor_eth.24.d:0 "It seems the waves of Oromo settlers moving into our lands have finally faltered. The immigrants themselves have also begun to settle down and while our society is changed in many ways the violent initial phase of integration of this new people seem to be over."
 flavor_eth.24.a:0 "Ok."
 flavor_eth.26.t:0 "Amba Geshen - The Mountain of Kings"
 flavor_eth.26.d:0 "Once, our great kingdom was plagued by crisis and civil strife upon every succession. In order to deal with this problem one of the first of the Solomonic kings therefore set up the institution of Mount Geshen. Ever since that day all royal princes except the direct heir of the king are kept isolated from the outside world on the slopes of Mount Geshen. The state ensures that these potential kings lack for nothing and this time of isolation may be used for study and contemplation by the princes. In order to protect the princes from the outside world, and in order to protect the kingdom from the claims of the princes, the mountain is kept under close guard.\nThis custom has served us well over the years and the kingdom has become much more stable than it once was. Still some feel that keeping all of our royal heirs in one place is quite risky.\nToday we find ourselves with an aging king and no heir to succeed, it is precisely in situations like these that the mountain might come in handy."
 flavor_eth.26.a:0 "We are fortunate that our ancestors had such foresight."
 flavor_eth.26.b:0 "We have no need for this gilded prison."
 flavor_eth.26.b.tt:0 "The mountain will be used for other purposes"
 flavor_eth.27.t:0 "Helen of Ethiopia"
 flavor_eth.27.d:0 "Early on in his reign king $MONARCH$ married the daughter of one of the Muslim chiefs of the kingdom. As the young woman converted and said her vows to the Ethiopian emperor there was no way to know that this would turn out to be one of the most influential persons in Ethiopian politics for years to come. Eleni or Helen would in time serve not only her husband but several successive kings after him as an able advisor and as a power behind the throne."
 flavor_eth.27.a:0 "Ok."
 flavor_eth.28.t:0 "Disaster at the Mountain of Kings"
 flavor_eth.28.d:0 "Nobody knows exactly what happened but news reached us today that all of the princes on Mount Geshen are dead. It would appear that someone managed to surprise the guards to then proceed to slaughter the royal heirs. As the kingdom tries to recover from the shock it is clear that this particular tradition will no longer be part of our national heritage."
 flavor_eth.28.a:0 "All is lost."
 
 #Kilawa Events
 flavor_zan.1.t:0 "Shirazi Islam and the Patricians of Kilwa"
 flavor_zan.1.d:1 "Most of the Swahili states are to this day ruled by dynasties that claim to be descended from the first Islamic migration into this region. The Islam practiced by these 'Shirazis', as they call themselves, is however not the most orthodox form of the religion. Many older local ceremonies are performed daily in our court and the Shirazi lineages are considered to have magical abilities that give them the right to rule these cities.\nAs the wealth of Kilwa and the other Swahili states grows however new waves of foreigners continue to arrive in great numbers. Traders from Oman, Persia, the Bahmani kingdom and other faraway lands have made our cities their home and a rising class of indigenous merchants has made these groups their partners. Many of the newcomers are abhorred by our traditions. If we would adopt a more orthodox form of Islam this would certainly help our relations with the other states of the Indian ocean, but there is a very real risk that it would undermine our own rule and hurt relations with the other Swahili states."
 flavor_zan.1.a:0 "We must follow the ways of our ancestors."
 flavor_zan.1.b:0 "Let us purge our kingdom of pagan beliefs and ceremonies."
 flavor_zan.2.t:0 "The Kilwa Chronicle"
 flavor_zan.2.d:0 "With more and more foreign traders arriving in the Swahili coast from orthodox Islamic states our old Shirazi ways have come more and more under fire. We have watched with disgust as some of the old Shirazi dynasties of the Swahili coast have been overthrown by a rising class of indigenous traders allied with the newcomers.\nAs one of the oldest and most powerful Shirazi dynasties however we still stand strong. In order to suitably impress foreigners and domestic troublemakers alike it might be best if we assigned our scribes to create a chronicle over our famous lineage, so that none may doubt our Shirazi origin and the old Islamic roots of our dynasty."
 flavor_zan.2.a:0 "Let us create such a Chronicle."
 flavor_zan.2.b:0 "We have more important matters to attend."
 flavor_zan.3.t:0 "Abandoning Shirazi traditions"
 flavor_zan.3.d:0 "In the process of reforming the religious establishment of our kingdom we have come to the point where we will need to make a choice in regards to which tradition we should try to emulate. Our kingdom is home to Persian Shiites, Ibadi traders from Oman as well as Indian and Turkish Sunni traders. Apart from theological considerations the form of Islam we will associate with is likely to shape the foreign policy of our kingdom for years to come."
 flavor_zan.3.a:0 "Our current reforms have been enough."
 flavor_zan.3.b:0 "Let us embrace Shiism."
 flavor_zan.3.c:0 "Let us align with the Ibadis."
 flavor_zan.3.od:0 "We should invite Sunni scholars to help reform our kingdom."
 flavor_zan.4.t:0 "Cannibals!"
 flavor_zan.4.d:0 "While our kingdom owes its entire existence to the Indian-Ocean trade network and holds very little real control over the African inland we must always be on our guard for the people of the interior. One such group, the cannibalistic Zimba, have been spreading fear along the coast far to our south. With little warning the Zimba suddenly descended on the city of Kilwa itself today. Many Kilwan citizens are now dead and even more have fled the city. It will take years for Kilwa to recover, we can scarcely remember a greater tragedy in the history of our kingdom."
 flavor_zan.4.a:0 "A day of sorrow."
 flavor_zan.4.b:0 "Use all resources to rebuild and restore Kilwa."
 flavor_zan.5.t:0 "Coup of Suleiman and Muhammad al-Mazlum"
 flavor_zan.5.d:0 "When Sultan Ismâ'îl ascended the throne of Kilwa in 1442 his rule was questioned by the local rulers in Zanzibar who supported his relative Said's bid to become sultan. Said's plot was however thwarted by the royal vizier Suleiman and the emir Muhammad al-Mazlum.\nWith the passing of Ismâ'îl himself however it seems Suleiman and Muhammad have decided that the time has come for them to rule in their own name. Acting quickly they have used their influence to secure the capital for themselves and have agreed to share power by taking the throne in turns."
 flavor_zan.5.a:0 "Suleiman takes the throne."
 flavor_zan.5.b:0 "Muhammad al-Muzlum takes the throne."
 flavor_zan.5.c:0 "$MONARCH$ is our rightful ruler!"
 flavor_zan.6.t:0 "Unpopular Coupmaker"
 flavor_zan.6.d:0 "While $MONARCH$ had served as minister of the throne in many years before usurping power directly his coup has made him unpopular among the citizens of Kilwa. Prominent citizens are now demanding his resignation and unless placated we may have a revolt on our hands sooner or later."
 flavor_zan.6.a:0 "Abdicate in favor of $HEIR$"
 flavor_zan.6.b:0 "Our ruler has won the right to this throne."
 flavor_zan.7.t:0 "Plotting Vizier"
 flavor_zan.7.d:0 "Holding on to the Kilwan throne has never been easy and with the great number of plots surrounding the coronation of monarchs over the last decades the post of Vizier in the royal government has become one sought by ambitious men wanting the throne for themselves rather than loyal administrators eager to serve the crown.\nThe faltering popularity of the monarchy lately was apparently all that our current Vizier needed to attempt to secure the throne for himself."
 flavor_zan.7.a:0 "Ok."
