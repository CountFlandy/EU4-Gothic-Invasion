 #Noble Estate Events#
 nobles_estate_events.1.t:0 "Noble Birth"
 nobles_estate_events.1.d:0 "Many of the families of the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ won their current position due to the actions of a forefather who served the state in times of war. For most of their sons a life in the field is therefore the only imaginable career. With the modernization of the army however common officers are no longer entirely unusual. Members of the Nobility have now approached us asking that we guarantee what they feel is the given right of their class. No man should be able to take service as a commander in the [Root.GetAdjective] armies who is not of noble birth!"
 nobles_estate_events.1.a:0 "Guarantee their right to command our armies."
 nobles_estate_events.1.b:0 "We cannot commit to such promises."
 nobles_estate_events.2.t:0 "Advancement of the $ESTATE_NOBLES$"
 nobles_estate_events.2.d:0 "The state is not the sole source of influence in our country. Over the last few decades a charismatic champion of the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ has successfully managed to increase the power of the leading families of the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ over most of the institutions of our country.\nContacts and privileges can be powerful things, especially combined with ambition."
 nobles_estate_events.2.a:0 "Ok."
 nobles_estate_events.3.t:0 "Encroachment of the $ESTATE_NOBLES$"
 nobles_estate_events.3.d:0 "It's hard to monitor everyone everywhere all the time and the boundaries between individual land properties are often grounded in old traditions or documents written when the landscape may have looked quite different. For someone with the right resources this can be exploited. A number of prominent $ESTATE_NOBLES$ families have used their considerable influence in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] to get away with expanding their properties considerably. If we want to protect the property of the state we must act soon."
 nobles_estate_events.3.a:0 "Let it slide."
 nobles_estate_events.3.b:0 "Demand that the land be returned."
 nobles_estate_events.4.t:0 "Tyrannical Nobles"
 nobles_estate_events.4.d:0 "A representative of the people living in an area dominated by one of the most prominent families of the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ has approached the throne today imploring the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to take action against what he claims are systematic abuses of power against the people there. As the ruler of [Root.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has a responsibility to protect his people, not doing so will make us appear weak and may harm the long-term growth of the province. The $ESTATE_NOBLES$ would likely not take kindly to chastising such a powerful member of their ranks however."
 nobles_estate_events.4.a:0 "Turn a blind eye."
 nobles_estate_events.4.b:0 "Chastise the landowner."
 nobles_estate_events.5.t:0 "Declining Power of the $ESTATE_NOBLES$"
 nobles_estate_events.5.d:0 "As both influential land owners and the traditional warrior class in our state the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ have not fared well lately. Through a combination of excessive infighting and poorly coordinated power plays the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ have lost influence in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] and many have retired to their properties in the countryside."
 nobles_estate_events.5.a:0 "Ok."
 nobles_estate_events.6.t:0 "$ESTATE_NOBLES$ demand Stricter Sumptuary Laws"
 nobles_estate_events.6.d:0 "Expensive clothes, great banquettes and impressive palaces are some of the most visible symbols of the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ but the degree to which one family has money to spend on such things can vary greatly. In some cases the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ of our country are able to spend just as lavishly if not more so than the average noble. While there are old rules and traditions restricting such things for those of less noble birth these are hard to enforce efficiently. This is unacceptable to the powerful $ESTATE_NOBLES$ of our country who are now demanding that we update our laws on what an outsider can and cannot wear. They now suggest a number of heavy fines for anyone trying to rise visibly above their betters."
 nobles_estate_events.6.a:0 "Bend to the wishes of the $ESTATE_NOBLES$."
 nobles_estate_events.6.b:0 "Refuse to obey the $ESTATE_NOBLES$."
 nobles_estate_events.7.t:0 "The Levee"
 nobles_estate_events.7.d:0 "In time many of the everyday occurrences in the life of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] predecessors has become the subject of ceremony. Being able to attend the bedroom of the ruler as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] dresses for instance is considered by many to be the best way to gain the ear of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. An elaborate court life will certainly limit the power of our nobles to plot against us in their countryside properties but it could also prove quite expensive. Denying them the right to be part of the daily life of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] entirely on the other hand would also limit their influence but the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ would likely resent it."
 nobles_estate_events.7.a:0 "Let's keep it at a modest level."
 nobles_estate_events.7.b:0 "An elaborate and lengthy ceremony for the most influential."
 nobles_estate_events.7.c:0 "We have no need of such things."
 nobles_estate_events.8.t:0 "Deteriorating Relations with the $ESTATE_NOBLES$"
 nobles_estate_events.8.d:0 "Relations between the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] could hardly be worse. The great sense of distrust is plainly visible by the almost deserted court in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] as most prominent families keep to their countryside manors. Unless we do something soon state authority will deteriorate in the areas controlled by the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ but any demands from the state will likely be met with arms in hand at this point."
 nobles_estate_events.8.a:0 "Leave them be."
 nobles_estate_events.8.b:0 "Force them to accept state authority."
 nobles_estate_events.9.t:0 "Insubordinate $ESTATE_NOBLES$"
 nobles_estate_events.9.d:0 "None of our subjects are more associated with war than the $ESTATE_NOBLES$. Generations ago their families served us or the states before us and won their current status on the field of battle. Ever since then most of them have kept their old traditions alive, training for a life in the field and making connections with others of the same inclination.\nThe current state of affairs in our country however has left us with few members of the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ willing to fight our battles. Insubordination has become widespread among the higher officers and we have good reason to suspect more than a few hope for an unsuccessful war."
 nobles_estate_events.9.a:0 "Unfortunate."
 nobles_estate_events.9.b:0 "It is high time we replaced them with men of true ability."
 nobles_estate_events.9.c:0 "It is high time we replaced them with men we can trust."
 nobles_estate_events.9.dd:0 "Let us consult the Brahmins, some of these learned men are clearly fit to lead."
 nobles_estate_events.10.t:0 "Growth of the Administration"
 nobles_estate_events.10.d:0 "As the state and its bureaucracy grow there is an ever-growing need of people to oversee and administrate various lands and functions. The $ESTATE_NOBLES$ have traditionally been more associated with military services to the state but have increasingly made it clear that they still expect to be first in line when government offices are being handed out. The $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ on the other hand claim that the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ considers such appointments as mere rewards and will use them only to enrich themselves. Instead the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ argue we should appoint men out of individual merit.\nThe unexpected death of a trusted secretary has left a vacant position to be filled at the center of this conflict, with the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ supporting one candidate and the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ expecting us to pick another. While both candidates are talented men this has to be a political decision."
 nobles_estate_events.10.a:0 "With a great pedigree come great abilities."
 nobles_estate_events.10.b:0 "Self-made men are what we need to run this country."
 nobles_estate_events.10.c:0 "Let us turn to the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ instead."
 nobles_estate_events.10.dd:0 "Let us turn to the $ESTATE_DHIMMI$ instead."
 nobles_estate_events.11.t:0 "Tradition of Service"
 nobles_estate_events.11.d:0 "The $ESTATE_NOBLES$ have a long tradition of service to the state both as military leaders or more recently as dependable administrators. In a state where the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ are as strongly entrenched and loyal as ours this means that from time to time nobles of great talent and loyalty will emerge to lead the country to greatness."
 nobles_estate_events.11.a:0 "Great!"
 nobles_estate_events.12.t:0 "Rise of the [Root.GetName] $ESTATE_NOBLES$"
 nobles_estate_events.12.d:0 "The $ESTATE_NOBLES$ are refusing to accept the confiscation of their property in [Root.GetName] and have risen in revolt against us!"
 nobles_estate_events.12.a:0 "Ok."
 nobles_estate_events.13.t:0 "Wavering Loyalty of the $ESTATE_NOBLES$"
 nobles_estate_events.13.d:0 "Good relations need to be maintained. As their numbers grow and some of the leaders of the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ grow older our warm relations have grown colder. We need to make arrangements with the current breed of $ESTATE_NOBLES$ in order to be sure of their loyalty."
 nobles_estate_events.13.a:0 "Ok."

 #Burgher Estate Events#
 burghers_estate_events.1.t:0 "Advancement of the Merchant Classes"
 burghers_estate_events.1.d:0 "The status of the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ does not rest on the same old traditions as that of the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ or the $ESTATE_CHURCH$. Instead they have had to make their own fortunes by working diligently and then risking the profit to again expand their businesses. As a rule however this has gone very well for them lately. While not as prestigious business is in many ways the backbone of our economy and through their control of the coins the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ have managed to increase their power over our country."
 burghers_estate_events.1.a:0 "Ok."
 burghers_estate_events.2.t:0 "Robber Barons"
 burghers_estate_events.2.d:0 "The $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ are concerned with the great influence of the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ in our state. They claim that many lower members of the nobility are disregarding the peace and law of the land, using their position of power and the lands they hold to take up unreasonable tolls and taxes for traders passing by. Some are even said to attack and waylay merchants, robbing or extorting them of their money.\nRepresentatives of the [Root.GetAdjective] $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ now claim that the economic development of our country is held back by these excesses. The $ESTATE_NOBLES$ on the other hand argue that they are simply charging reasonably for the use of their roads property. Some are willing to give the state a part of the share they take."
 burghers_estate_events.2.a:0 "They only take what is their right."
 burghers_estate_events.2.b:0 "We must curb such excesses!"
 burghers_estate_events.3.t:0 "Decline of the Merchant Classes"
 burghers_estate_events.3.d:0 "Without the old privileges and pedigrees of other factions the status and influence of the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ is rarely quite as secure as that of those born into power. Lately a combination of financial misfortune and misdirected political ambitions have resulted in a loss of power and influence for the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ of [Root.GetName]."
 burghers_estate_events.3.a:0 "Ok."
 burghers_estate_events.4.t:0 "Growing City Request Privileges"
 burghers_estate_events.4.d:0 "The $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ of an increasingly important trading city have approached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] today asking to be granted privileges to be able to make the region thrive without the hindrance of many of our normal taxes. Should we provide them with these means to grow they assure us that the economy of the area would quickly improve, resulting in more wealth for the state."
 burghers_estate_events.4.a:0 "Accept the Petition."
 burghers_estate_events.4.b:0 "Reject the Petition."
 burghers_estate_events.5.t:0 "Immoral Prices"
 burghers_estate_events.5.d:0 "Grain prices are notoriously unstable, anything from the weather where it is grown to incidents hurting its distribution can suddenly cause the price to rise significantly. As a result of one such sudden change there is currently an acute shortage of grain in many of our larger cities. Desperate to feed themselves the common people are directing their anger at the merchants who they feel are making good use of this situation to overcharge for their wares. The Merchant's themselves on the other hand claim that this is a natural result of the shortage and that there simply isn't enough bread to go around."
 burghers_estate_events.5.a:0 "Force the Merchants to lower their prices."
 burghers_estate_events.5.b:0 "We should not meddle in these things."
 burghers_estate_events.5.c:0 "We must pay for and distribute what bread there is."
 burghers_estate_events.6.t:0 "Parallel Authority"
 burghers_estate_events.6.d:0 "The $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ are not the sole authority within their cities, the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ also have a strong presence in most big cities going back to their initial founding. Conflicts sometimes arise when the councils of the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ implement rules that the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ disapprove of.\nSuch conflicts have become more and more commonplace and members of the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ are openly acting in defiance of the various rules the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ have agreed upon in their cities. Delegates from various $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ dominated cities are now urging us to clarify the situation."
 burghers_estate_events.6.a:0 "Side with the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$."
 burghers_estate_events.6.b:0 "Side with the $ESTATE_CHURCH$."
 burghers_estate_events.7.t:0 "Extended Privileges for the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$"
 burghers_estate_events.7.d:0 "The $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ feel that they are unduly taxed and regulated when taking in mind the great importance of their work for our country. Tolls, taxes and various tariffs are holding them back from being able to accomplish even greater things and they will not hesitate to use all of their influence to abolish them."
 burghers_estate_events.7.a:0 "Let us remove these obstacles!"
 burghers_estate_events.7.b:0 "The $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ need to know their place!"
 burghers_estate_events.8.t:0 "Hurtful Trade Policies"
 burghers_estate_events.8.d:0 "The interests of prominent merchant households are being hurt by our repressive trade policies towards other countries. The $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ support these families and have now petitioned us to compensate them by at least opening up some other restrictions on trade to compensate for their loss of income."
 burghers_estate_events.8.a:0 "We must support the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$."
 burghers_estate_events.8.b:0 "We cannot let our trade policy be decided by these peddlers."
 burghers_estate_events.9.t:0 "Cottage Industry"
 burghers_estate_events.9.d:0 "Economic development is not always without conflict. It seems rich Merchants in some of our $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ dominated cities have been attempting to bypass various guild privileges by outsourcing work to the homes of families living outside the city. The fact that this 'Putting-out System' has been a very profitable strategy only further enflame the Artisans in the city who feel their ancient rights have been trampled and that the carefully managed prices of their products will suffer. The [Root.GetAdjective] artisans now turn to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to defend their privileges as the city councils has been unable to root out competition not based in the cities."
 burghers_estate_events.9.a:0 "We cannot stand in the way of progress."
 burghers_estate_events.9.b:0 "We must safeguard the guild privileges."
 burghers_estate_events.10.t:0 "Social Mobility"
 burghers_estate_events.10.d:0 "The growing power of the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ has led to individuals from within their ranks to seek their fortunes in areas traditionally dominated by other groups. The sons of mid to low prominence families of the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ now have the education and the ambition to match the more privileged classes and as a result an increasing number of them are now being employed as administrators, lawyers, officers as well as in other positions traditionally dominated by another estate. The $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ still feel they are being unduly held back by the archaic rights and privileges of another era but their adversaries are growing very weary of the current 'unnatural' social mobility.\nUnless we do something we risk losing the support of the privileged classes but if we withdraw our support of the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ at this point this will likely have grave effects on our relations with them."
 burghers_estate_events.10.a:0 "We must not stand in the way of these new men."
 burghers_estate_events.10.b:0 "We must protect the ancient rights of the other Estates."
 burghers_estate_events.11.t:0 "Growth of the Economy"
 burghers_estate_events.11.d:0 "Our policy of cooperation with the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ has come to bear fruit in the form of economic development in many fields. The cities of the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ are prospering and our influence in international trade is growing rapidly."
 burghers_estate_events.11.a:0 "Great."
 burghers_estate_events.12.t:0 "The risks of Trade"
 burghers_estate_events.12.d:0 "Trade over large distances can be risky, if profitable. The weather, brigands and pirates remain a threat on land as well as on water. Normally the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ can cope with a certain amount of mishaps and have their own ways to protect themselves and insure their cargo. Lately however things have been going badly for a large number of Merchant families and some are at risk of bankruptcy. It may be prudent to offer some financial compensation to get them back on their feet."
 burghers_estate_events.12.a:0 "Compensate the Traders."
 burghers_estate_events.12.b:0 "They knew what they were getting into."
 burghers_estate_events.13.t:0 "Urbanization"
 burghers_estate_events.13.d:0 "While only a small portion of our population live in the cities the growing prosperity of the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ is attracting an increasing number of people from the countryside. Some cities are growing so quickly that existing problems in terms of sanitation and overcrowding have gone from troubling to catastrophic according to the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$. The poor have taken up residence outside the city walls where filthy suburbs have sprung up and disease thrives.\nThe $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ find the situation intolerable and are now requesting that the state step in to provide help both in terms of resources and enforcement of rules outside of the walls. Only this way can this increasing urbanization actually lead to something good."
 burghers_estate_events.13.a:0 "Attempt to improve conditions."
 burghers_estate_events.13.b:0 "This is nothing unusual, the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ can handle it."
 burghers_estate_events.14.t:0 "Economic Policy"
 burghers_estate_events.14.d:0 "As the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ grow in power their calls for fewer trade regulations and taxes become more and more frequent. Many feel our country has an old-fashioned and repressive trade policy and that we would benefit from reducing the amount of taxes and tolls that hinder commerce."
 burghers_estate_events.14.a:0 "Reduce Mercantilism."
 burghers_estate_events.14.b:0 "Refuse to change the Trade Policy."
 burghers_estate_events.15.t:0 "Protests among the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$"
 burghers_estate_events.15.d:0 "The continuously deteriorating relationship between the state and the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ has reached the point where there is little trust at all for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] in our major cities. Every state initiative is suspected at being aimed to contain the power of the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ and tax evasion has become widespread.\nIt has now come to the point that a number of guilds have begun a general strike, demanding greater autonomy and freedom from the overbearing state."
 burghers_estate_events.15.a:0 "They must be joking!"
 burghers_estate_events.15.b:0 "Give in to their demands."
 burghers_estate_events.16.t:0 "Revolt of the [Root.GetName] $ESTATE_BURGHERS$"
 burghers_estate_events.16.d:0 "Appalled at the loss of their privileges the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ of the [Root.GetName] province have taken up arms against us!"
 burghers_estate_events.16.a:0 "Ok."
 burghers_estate_events.17.t:0 "Wavering Loyalty of the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$"
 burghers_estate_events.17.d:0 "Good relations need to be maintained. As their numbers grow and some of the leaders of the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ grow older our warm relations have grown colder. We need to make arrangements with the current breed of $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ leaders in order to be sure of their loyalty."
 burghers_estate_events.17.a:0 "Ok."
 
 #Church Estate Events#
 church_estate_events.1.t:0 "Libertas Ecclesiae"
 church_estate_events.1.d:0 "The $ESTATE_CHURCH$ has long been one of the foremost pillars of the [Root.GetAdjective] realm, providing not only spiritual guidance but also administrators, judges and diplomats for the benefit of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. In return for these great services no ecclesiastical manor, monastery or other estate pay any taxes to the state and the temporal authorities do not meddle in the internal affairs of the $ESTATE_CHURCH$.\nTimes grow dire however and the state has to cover an increasing number of expenses. Suggestions that perhaps the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ might make a voluntary contribution have not been favorably received."
 church_estate_events.1.a:0 "Make it clear that they need to contribute."
 church_estate_events.1.b:0 "We will find the money elsewhere."
 church_estate_events.101.t:0 "Temple Lands"
 church_estate_events.101.d:0 "The $ESTATE_CHURCH$ has long been one of the foremost pillars of the [Root.GetAdjective] realm, providing not only spiritual guidance but also administrators, judges and diplomats for the benefit of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. In return for these great services many donations have been made over the years, both by the state and by others, in the form of villages to support the Brahman communities. These Brahmadeyas have over the centuries made our $ESTATE_CHURCH$ quite rich.\nTimes grow dire however and the state has to cover an increasing number of expenses. Suggestions that perhaps the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ might make a voluntary contribution have not been favorably received."
 church_estate_events.102.t:0 "The Riches of the $ESTATE_CHURCH$"
 church_estate_events.102.d:0 "The $ESTATE_CHURCH$ has long been one of the foremost pillars of the [Root.GetAdjective] realm, providing not only spiritual guidance but also administrators, judges and diplomats for the benefit of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. In return for these great services many donations have been made over the years, both by the state and by others, to the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ and the gods they serve. These gifts have over the centuries made the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ quite rich and influential.\nTimes grow dire however and the state has to cover an increasing number of expenses. Suggestions that perhaps the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ might make a voluntary contribution have not been favorably received."
 church_estate_events.103.t:0 "The Riches of the $ESTATE_CHURCH$"
 church_estate_events.103.d:0 "The $ESTATE_CHURCH$ have always been the foremost pillars of the [Root.GetAdjective] realm, providing not only spiritual guidance but also administrators, judges and diplomats for the benefit of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. In return for these great services many lands have been set aside as religious properties, exempt from most of our taxes. This way the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ and the many fine projects they support can be provided for.\nTimes grow dire however and the state has to cover an increasing number of expenses. Suggestions that perhaps the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ might make a voluntary contribution have not been favorably received."
 church_estate_events.104.t:0 "The Riches of the $ESTATE_CHURCH$"

 church_estate_events.105.d:0 "The $ESTATE_CHURCH$ have long been one of the foremost pillars of the [Root.GetAdjective] realm, providing not only spiritual guidance but also administrators, law scholars and diplomats for the benefit of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. In return for these great services many donations have been made over the years, both by the state and by others, to the great $ESTATE_CHURCH$ and their extensive land properties. These gifts have over the centuries made the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ quite rich and influential.\nTimes grow dire however and the state has to cover an increasing number of expenses. Suggestions that perhaps the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ might make a voluntary contribution have not been favorably received."
 church_estate_events.2.t:0 "Advancement of the $ESTATE_CHURCH$"
 church_estate_events.2.d:0 "The power of the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ has never relied on the state itself. Rather it is in many ways the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ who through their ties to the spiritual realm lend their legitimacy to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. A combination of deft political maneuvering, perceived bad omens and generous donations from our subjects have lately cemented the power of this estate."
 church_estate_events.2.a:0 "Ok."
 church_estate_events.3.t:0 "$ESTATE_CHURCH$ losing Power"
 church_estate_events.3.d:0 "More than any other Estate the influence of the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ is dependent on their standing with the common man. It has been hard to put the finger at exactly why but over the recent years the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ has come to be seen less as the spiritual guardians of our country and more as rich and corrupted intrigue-makers. Combined with some unfortunate investments in the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ properties themselves and poor political maneuvering the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ have been losing both power and influence."
 church_estate_events.3.a:0 "Ok."
 church_estate_events.4.t:0 "Anticlericalism"
 church_estate_events.4.d:0 "The $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ of several prominent cities are accusing the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ of being greedy and indolent. The pious commoners are now withholding the tithe in a protest against a particularly bad example of misuse of the authority of the $ESTATE_CHURCH$. Pious $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ are now objecting to paying tithes to the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ as they consider the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ unfit to receive them.\nThe $ESTATE_CHURCH$ are furious and demand that we fine the obstinate $ESTATE_BURGHERS$."
 church_estate_events.4.a:0 "Then we must force them to pay!"
 church_estate_events.4.b:0 "A mild reprimand will be enough."
 church_estate_events.5.t:0 "Deteriorating Relations with the $ESTATE_CHURCH$"
 church_estate_events.5.d:0 "Relations between the state and the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ has now sunk low enough that it is entirely characterized by distrust and even open defiance. The Holy Places of our nation are centers of resistance to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and most of the faithful in our lands are doubting the legitimacy of our rule.\nWith things as they are it comes as no surprise that all it took for the situation to ignite was one small misstep by our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] during a religious ceremony last week. The peasants are now rising all over our country with the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ inciting them and directing their anger towards us."
 church_estate_events.5.a:0 "Ok."
 church_estate_events.6.t:0 "Triumph of the $ESTATE_CHURCH$?"
 church_estate_events.6.d:0 "While none would openly defy the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ there are few states where they are as influential as in [Root.GetName]. There isn't a single institution in our country that isn't entirely under the influence of the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ and the power of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] depends on them now more than ever.\nIt is perhaps only natural that the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ now also wishes to take a more active role in the practical ruling of our country. Lately a number of suggestions have been made by their representatives to further harmonize our laws and traditions with those of the spiritual realm. The ambition is to cleanse our court culture from any unorthodoxy and to ensure that the country is governed according to religiously sound rules and ideals."
 church_estate_events.6.a:0 "Follow the recommendations of the $ESTATE_CHURCH$."
 church_estate_events.6.b:0 "Reject their authority."
 church_estate_events.7.t:0 "Strong $ESTATE_CHURCH$"
 church_estate_events.7.d:0 "While many rulers can rely on the support of the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ few have as strong supporters as we do. A long tradition of close cooperation and loyalty between us and $ESTATE_CHURCH$ has resulted in a situation where the Church thinks of itself as a part of the state administration rather than an independent actor. Throughout our state the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ are spreading the word of the excellence and spiritual strength of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 church_estate_events.7.a:0 "Great."
 church_estate_events.8.t:0 "Land Theft"
 church_estate_events.8.d:0 "Many land donations are quite old and while they are always written down both landscape and names may well have changed since a donation was originally written. Recently the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ have been accusing several members of the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ of outright land theft in the form of encroaching on lands donated to the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ long ago. The $ESTATE_NOBLES$ on the other hand argue that it is the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ who are trying to seize land areas they do not own.\nWhoever we decide to side with will become the majority land holder in the area."
 church_estate_events.8.a:0 "Side with the $ESTATE_CHURCH$."
 church_estate_events.8.b:0 "Side with the $ESTATE_NOBLES$."
 church_estate_events.8.c:0 "Favor neither party."

 church_estate_events.9.d:0 "There has always been some discrepancy between the religion actually taught and defended by the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ and the actual faith of the people in the provinces. Most of the time the differences are small enough that the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ chooses to ignore them to instead focus on reinforce the more orthodox spiritual ideas of the people.\nIt seems however that certain ideas that are quite unorthodox, if rooted in old traditions, have begun to spread together with the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith among our non-[Root.Religion.GetName] subjects. The resulting mix of old heathen ideas, popular superstitions and the actual [Root.Religion.GetName] itself has been quite too much for the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ to stomach even if it seems to have made conversion a much more attractive proposition for our heathen subjects."

 church_estate_events.10.d:0 "The time has come for the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ to appoint a new leader to assist our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] in the capital. The likely candidate is an old cleric with a solid history as a prominent member of the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ behind him. He has however also acquired many enemies during his life who now hope to see a somewhat younger candidate with a less ugly past be appointed. As [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] it would not be hard to influence this election to the younger candidate who would likely be more loyal. To be seen to meddle in the affairs of the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ however would very likely weaken the faction in the long run."

 #Dhimmi Estate Events#
 dhimmi_estate_events.1.t:0 "Overzealous Qadi"
 dhimmi_estate_events.1.d:0 "The Qadi in one of our major cities has been using his influence to interpret Islamic law as well as the edicts of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] a bit too zealously. Not content to keep the status quo in the largely non-Muslim city he has been trying to actively force the non-believers to convert while systematically closing down their centers of worship.\nAfter a recent suicide by a force-converted trader non-Muslims are now leaving the city en masse to settle somewhere more welcoming. While even the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ largely seem to find these actions too extreme they would likely consider any action taken against the Qadi to be much worse."
 dhimmi_estate_events.1.a:0 "Stand by the Qadi."
 dhimmi_estate_events.1.b:0 "Replace the Qadi and try to make amends."
 dhimmi_estate_events.2.t:0 "Demands to lessen Taxes on Heathens"
 dhimmi_estate_events.2.d:0 "As our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was on his way to the weekly procession to the royal Mosque a large number of $ESTATE_DHIMMI$ had assembled in front of the building, preventing the passage of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and demanding that some of the discriminatory taxes against non-Muslims such as the temple or pilgrimage taxes be revoked."
 dhimmi_estate_events.2.a:0 "Trample the dissenters!"
 dhimmi_estate_events.2.b:0 "Revoke some of the Taxes!"
 dhimmi_estate_events.3.t:0 "Religious Pragmatism"
 dhimmi_estate_events.3.d:0 "While not everyone may like it the non-Muslims in our realm have been growing in influence over the last few years. Members of the Dhimmi are frequently seen even among the more important Trade Guilds of our country and many serve as administrators in our provinces or have been allowed to keep their hereditary titles."
 dhimmi_estate_events.3.a:0 "Ok."
 dhimmi_estate_events.4.t:0 "Marginalization of the Dhimmi"
 dhimmi_estate_events.4.d:0 "While they make up an important part of our society the non-Muslims have lately been losing ground to other groups. They are regularly looked over for any type of government service, have to pay a number of discriminatory taxes and often see business deals going to their Muslim competitors."
 dhimmi_estate_events.4.a:0 "Ok."
 dhimmi_estate_events.5.t:0 "The $ESTATE_DHIMMI$ and the $ESTATE_NOBLES$"
 dhimmi_estate_events.5.d:0 "Many among the Muslim $ESTATE_NOBLES$ have been voicing complaints at what they feel is an unjust and unfair favoring of infidels in our government. Having sought the support of the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ they now claim that we are running our country contrary to established Islamic customs and that we must ensure that the infidel are kept out of positions of influence.\nThe construction of a new shrine in a province largely dominated by the $ESTATE_DHIMMI$ entirely funded by local nobles and merchants has escalated the situation further with the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ and the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ demanding that we tear down the holy building and put the infidels in their place."
 dhimmi_estate_events.5.a:0 "We must listen to the $ESTATE_NOBLES$."
 dhimmi_estate_events.5.b:0 "Stand by the $ESTATE_DHIMMI$."

 dhimmi_estate_events.6.d:0 "Traditionally the $ESTATE_DHIMMI$ are excluded from service in many of the higher positions in the administration. Instead these are generally given to faithful Muslim literati. As our government apparatus grows however it has a constant thirst for more learned men and among the $ESTATE_DHIMMI$ there are many that would fit this description. While some would consider it unorthodox we could probably greatly benefit from recruiting from their numbers."
 dhimmi_estate_events.6.a:0 "Let's put these learned men to good use."
 dhimmi_estate_events.6.b:0 "We cannot risk their assimilative capabilities."
 dhimmi_estate_events.7.t:0 "Infidel Brigands"
 dhimmi_estate_events.7.d:0 "The quickly deteriorating relations between the state and the $ESTATE_DHIMMI$ have resulted in local relations breaking down entirely in some areas. Tax collectors tell tales of convoys vanishing on the route between areas dominated by the Dhimmi, together with what had been collected. In the cities the priests and leaders of the $ESTATE_DHIMMI$ agitate against us and it has become increasingly hard to keep track of our subjects even within the walls. Even those opposed to $ESTATE_DHIMMI$ influence now find that they question our ability to rule."

 dhimmi_estate_events.8.t:0 "Riches of the $ESTATE_DHIMMI$"
 dhimmi_estate_events.8.d:0 "Throughout the Islamic world the term $ESTATE_DHIMMI$ has come to be applied to a wide and disparate variety of people. The traditional and more restrictive definition of only Christians and Jews has quickly been abandoned by Muslim states where the majority populations are Hindus or Buddhists. Regardless of who are included the $ESTATE_DHIMMI$ receive protection in exchange for being exempt from many of the laws of the realm.\nWhile this may seem unfortunate for them it is quite fortunate for us right now, while the general economy is currently still recovering from recent wars many families of the Dhimmi still hold quite large cash reserves and they have no laws or rules forbidding them from investing or lending it to others."
 dhimmi_estate_events.8.a:0 "Convince the $ESTATE_DHIMMI$ to invest in economic recovery."
 dhimmi_estate_events.8.b:0 "We must not make ourselves dependent on infidels."

 cossack_estate_events.1.d:0 "The $ESTATE_NOBLES$ complain that an increasing number of serfs are deserting the safe homes provided to them to seek their fortune among the $ESTATE_COSSACKS$ of the Steppes. They feel we are to blame as we have allowed the $ESTATE_COSSACKS$ to grow too powerful which is inspiring the serfs to abandon their rightful masters.\nRepresentatives of the major families now demand that we limit the power of the $ESTATE_COSSACKS$ so that they can expand their latifundia in the regions bordering the steppe. This way, they argue, the wild fields can be tamed and the laws of the realm upheld."
 cossack_estate_events.1.a:0 "These Serfs must be brought back."

Several such raids have lately laid waste to our countryside and even major cities some way from our borders. Once a raid has been executed these plunderers retreat back behind the borders of our neighboring countries as quickly as they came. Both the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ and our $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ have interests in the affected areas and both groups now demand that we do something."

Several such raids have lately laid waste to the [From.GetAdjective] countryside and even major cities some way from our borders.\nAs the $ESTATE_COSSACKS$ responsible are based inside our borders the [From.GetAdjective] have now demanded both compensation and for the culprits to be brought to justice."
 cossack_estate_events.3.a:0 "This matter is beyond our control."

 cossack_estate_events.4.t:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] Response"

 cossack_estate_events.4.a:0 "We care little for such excuses."
 cossack_estate_events.5.t:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] Response"
 cossack_estate_events.5.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] response has been to send some monetary compensation for the raids of their Cossack subjects which has made up for the damage to property. They also claim that they have brought the guilty parties to justice."

 cossack_estate_events.6.d:0 "While few would dispute their influence on the Steppes the $ESTATE_COSSACKS$ have many things working against them when it comes to gaining influence in the halls of power. The $ESTATE_NOBLES$ despise them and would see them all brought to work as serfs on their latifundia and their manners have not brought them many friends in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName].\nLately however things have been going their way.

 cossack_estate_events.7.d:0 "The free nature of the $ESTATE_COSSACKS$ and the distance between them and the halls of power in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] has always been a problem for them. Lacking hereditary privileges the number of Cossacks registered with the state as officers with the benefits that entail have been decreasing steadily."

Traditionally rights are awarded to specific $ESTATE_COSSACKS$ that are willing to perform great services to the state in times of war. As these rights are not transferrable upon death this means that the influence of the $ESTATE_COSSACKS$ can vary greatly over time. According to the $ESTATE_COSSACKS$ it is high time we grant them further privileges to bolster our numbers."

 cossack_estate_events.9.d:0 "Life on the frontier can be harsh and while the $ESTATE_COSSACKS$ are used to fighting their own battles a little help from the central treasury could probably be put to good use. Last season was unusually harsh and together with an increasing number of Tatar incursions many $ESTATE_COSSACKS$ now have an urgent shortage of food for the coming months. If we were to supply the $ESTATE_COSSACKS$ with grain as well as military supplies such as arms and uniforms we would not only be strengthening our defenders on the Steppes directly we would likely also tie them closer to our state."

 cossack_estate_events.10.d:0 "There has always been tension between the $ESTATE_COSSACKS$ and the other estates, if nothing else because of their uncommon manners and diverse backgrounds. Lately however these have increased considerably. The $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ are alarmed at the $ESTATE_COSSACKS$ raids and claim that they are targeting shipments of their grain. The $ESTATE_COSSACKS$ themselves claim that they are only attacking the Tartars and brigands in the area and that the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ are simply mistaken. As there is little in the way of government representation in the area it is difficult to ascertain the truth but there is clearly friction between these two groups and we are expected to either reprimand or sanction one side in this conflict."

 cossack_estate_events.11.t:0 "Cossack Settlers"
 cossack_estate_events.11.d:0 "The life of the Steppes has made the $ESTATE_COSSACKS$ used to a frontier living. Constant threats from both a harsh climate in an unsettled land and of Tartar raiders have made the $ESTATE_COSSACKS$ both feared warriors and hardy settlers.\nAs we turn our sights on the lands of Central Asia and Siberia it is becoming apparent that life on the eastern frontier is not that different from that of the Steppes we already control."

 cossack_estate_events.13.t:0 "Cossack Expansion"
 cossack_estate_events.13.d:0 "Borders can often be theoretical things, especially in the wild fields. It seems the $ESTATE_COSSACKS$ have expanded rapidly into an area that previously wasn't under their control.
