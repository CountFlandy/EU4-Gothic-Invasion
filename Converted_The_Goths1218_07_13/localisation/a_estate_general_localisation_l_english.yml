#Rev Republic Factions#
 revolutionary_republic_factions.0.t:0 "Turmoil in the Army"
 revolutionary_republic_factions.0.d:0 "Breaking the chains of the old regime has finally freed the top of the officer corps from the restraining links between birth and promotion. No doubt our army will soon be lead by men of merit that will outclass the old crops of aristocrats. Right now however the sudden lack of experienced officers at the top as well as the great influx of new recruits at the bottom has lead to a somewhat volatile atmosphere in our ranks. Patriotism and revolutionary fervor is a strong motivator but without able leadership any army can find itself unable to perform to expectations."
 revolutionary_republic_factions.0.a:0 "We could never compromise with our ideology!"
 revolutionary_republic_factions.0.b:0 "Men of ambition is what we need. Let them reshape our army!"
 revolutionary_republic_factions.0.c:0 "We must do what we can to keep the old men of quality for now."
 revolutionary_republic_factions.1.t:0 "For the lack of a cord..."
 revolutionary_republic_factions.1.d:0 "The old regime was always tightly tied to the power of the clergy and the fear of the divine is one of the ways to control the people that our radicals hate the most. Therefore the confiscation of religious property and the requirement for all clergy to swear an oath of loyalty to a Civil Constitution have been high on the agenda for many in the National Assembly. Outside the radicals not everyone in the assembly agrees on the best course of action and our policy has wavered a bit over time. Atheism is not always the most popular with the masses and especially in the countryside our actions against local priests have been met with contempt.\nPerhaps it could be beneficial to scale back our radicalism a bit without abandoning the long term goal of freeing society from Religion?"
 revolutionary_republic_factions.1.a:0 "We cannot betray our ideology!"
 revolutionary_republic_factions.1.b:0 "The clergy can be useful to uphold order."
 revolutionary_republic_factions.1.c:0 "We can give some leeway here."
 revolutionary_republic_factions.2.t:0 "The Favor of the Mob"
 revolutionary_republic_factions.2.d:0 "The poor and destitute people of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] have in many ways been empowered by the revolution far more than other groups in our Republic. While the goal is to break the chains of the old order for all those who have been oppressed for so long the citizens of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] are close to the seat of power and can make their will known to their representatives directly. Some even fear the will of what they consider to be an unruly mob which changes its loyalty on a whim. Others stress that this 'mob' is a direct manifestation of the will of the people and that we would all do well to listen to it."
 revolutionary_republic_factions.2.a:0 "They need someone to speak for them!"
 revolutionary_republic_factions.2.a.tt:0 "By empowering and flattering the common people [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] we will strengthen the popularity of our government."
 revolutionary_republic_factions.2.b:0 "To the army!"
 revolutionary_republic_factions.2.b.tt:0 "We will harness the patriotism of the people of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] by enlisting them in the ranks of our grand army. The revolution must be spread abroad!"
 revolutionary_republic_factions.2.c:0 "We cannot let fear govern this great country."
 revolutionary_republic_factions.2.c.tt:0 "We will empower those that want to curtail the power of the masses in order to restore order and authority to our fair Republic."
 revolutionary_republic_factions.3.t:0 "Wavering Loyalty"
 revolutionary_republic_factions.3.da:0 "Ideological convictions can change and sometimes personal rivalries leave even high officials disillusioned with their former comrades in arms. A high ranking official of previous governments has recently gone over to those who he would formerly have considered his sworn enemies. With him he takes some of the dirtiest secrets of the $RR_GIRONDISTS$ and a fervent will to harm their influence in general and in the National Assembly in particular."
 revolutionary_republic_factions.3.db:0 "Ideological convictions can change and sometimes personal rivalries leave even high officials disillusioned with their former comrades in arms. A high ranking official of previous governments has recently gone over to those who he would formerly have considered his sworn enemies. With him he takes some of the dirtiest secrets of the $RR_ROYALISTS$ and a fervent will to harm their influence in general and in the National Assembly in particular."
 revolutionary_republic_factions.3.dc:0 "Ideological convictions can change and sometimes personal rivalries leave even high officials disillusioned with their former comrades in arms. A high ranking official of previous governments has recently gone over to those who he would formerly have considered his sworn enemies. With him he takes some of the dirtiest secrets of the $RR_JACOBINS$ and a fervent will to harm their influence in general and in the National Assembly in particular."
 revolutionary_republic_factions.3.a:0 "Interesting."
 revolutionary_republic_factions.4.t:0 "Enemies of the Revolution"
 revolutionary_republic_factions.4.d:0 "The enemies of the revolution are everywhere, even in our own midst. We cannot allow the nobles, priests and various representatives of the old order to go on as if nothing has happened. We must act swiftly and deliberately to squash any unrevolutionary behavior or suspicion of monarchism. To this end the $RR_JACOBINS$ have had the foresight to establish a court where the people can give their judgement on where we can find friends and foes. Who would be more suitable to identify the enemies of the revolution than the common citizens and citizenesses of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]?"
 revolutionary_republic_factions.4.a:0 "Equality, Liberty, Fraternity or Death!"
 revolutionary_republic_factions.5.t:0 "Consolidation of Power"
 revolutionary_republic_factions.5.d:0 "Ever since having been elected the new [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has been seeking to consolidate power. Various men of ambition have been either replaced or propped up, the members of the national assembly have been circumvented, marginalized and outmaneuvered at any possible opportunity. The people on the streets of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] are somewhat apprehensive of this activity but the presence of loyal troops and the support of the countryside population is keeping [Root.GetName] an unusually quiet and orderly country. For now."
 revolutionary_republic_factions.5.a:0 "Liberty and Public Order!"
 revolutionary_republic_factions.6.t:0 "A Constitution for [Root.GetName]"
 revolutionary_republic_factions.6.d:0 "While they have primarily come to be seen as the proponents of spreading the revolution abroad through military actions, $RR_GIRONDISTS$ are also in many ways the voice of the establishment. Now that they have achieved considerable influence in the National Assembly they are using that power to attempt to create a formalized set of rules, a constitution for our new country. This is not the first project of its kind and likely not the last but they hope it will bring us one step closer to a new order and an age of Liberalism, Equality and Brotherhood."
 revolutionary_republic_factions.6.a:0 "Long live the Republic!"
 revolutionary_republic_factions.7.t:0 "Lack of Administrators"
 revolutionary_republic_factions.7.d:0 "Crushing the old order has brought unparalleled justice and equality to the masses as well as substantial assets into the state treasury. It has however also meant a loss of experienced administrators, bureaucrats and clerics. $RR_GIRONDISTS$ have quickly become the faction of many of the various remaining members of the old establishment and while they claim to support the revolution in every principle they are dismayed by the direction things have taken lately. Many of these sons of lesser nobility, the old clergy and other privileged classes have withdrawn from public life and are leaving the country fearing for their lives.\nThis has left us with a state that has more to administrate but fewer people with the required experience to do so. With merit as the guiding principle of government we are certain to find new able citizens to take their place but this has still placed us in a bit of a situation for the time being."
 revolutionary_republic_factions.7.a:0 "This is a small price to pay for the furtherment of Man."
 revolutionary_republic_factions.7.b:0 "Let us try to get at least some of them to stay."
 revolutionary_republic_factions.8.t:0 "Popular Generals"
 revolutionary_republic_factions.8.d:0 "The foremost protector of our Republic and the values of the Revolution is our army. Unlike the representatives of the old order our ranks are filled by ordinary citizens fuelled by their burning patriotism and liberal convictions. A life in the army can also bring the most disparate people together and create strong bonds between the soldiers and their officers.\nThe popularity of some of our generals have now reached somewhat frightening levels and there are fears in the National Assembly that this will spread to the general populace due to our wide recruitment policies. We could try curtailing some of the more obviously dangerous men by giving them assignments out of our way but this would likely strengthen their supporters in their conviction of our own incompetence, at least in the short run."
 revolutionary_republic_factions.8.a:0 "This is inevitable but harmless."
 revolutionary_republic_factions.8.b:0 "Attempt to curtail some of the more threatening leaders."
 revolutionary_republic_factions.9.t:0 "[GetMonth] Massacres"
 revolutionary_republic_factions.9.d:0 "Fearing the influence of crypto-monarchists and anti-revolutionaries among the ruling elite the people of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] have taken to the streets to defend the spirit of the revolution. Everyone remotely associated with the old order, from [Root.Owner.Religion.GetName] priests, to members of the lesser nobility or even those already imprisoned for their crimes against the state have been targeted as radical $RR_JACOBINS$ do their best to inflame the hearts and minds of the masses.\nThis leaves the government in a somewhat precarious situation. Some of the persons being targeted are members of their own ranks, and these uncontrolled massacres are making us appear weak as it severely harms the well-being of our once beautiful city. Should we do anything to stop it however it will play right into the hands of the Jacobins..."
 revolutionary_republic_factions.9.a:0 "The enemies of the revolution must die!"
 revolutionary_republic_factions.9.b:0 "It is time to bring in the troops."
